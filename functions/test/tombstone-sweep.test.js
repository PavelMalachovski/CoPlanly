 * Fake Firestore serving one filtered query per collection and recording batched deletes.

 * handing back everything, because that filter is the safety property under test: a live
 * document has no `deletedAtMillis` at all, and Firestore does not return a document missing
 * the field a range query is on. A fake that ignored the filter would let a sweep that deleted
 * indiscriminately pass.
 *
 * @param {!Object<string, !Array<!Object>>} collections Documents per collection name.
 * @return {!Object} A fake with `_deleted` and `_commits` recorders.
