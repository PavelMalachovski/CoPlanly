## What this project is

CoPlanly — an Android shared-calendar app for separated parents. Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
(Material 3), Clean Architecture with Hilt, Room as the offline-first source of truth,
Firebase (Auth/Firestore/FCM) for sync between the two parents, Google Calendar integration,
Gemini for AI features.

**The authoritative roadmap is `docs/CoPlanly/MVP_phases.md`** (not `.cursor/roadmap.md`,
which is the historical original plan). MVP 1 is complete; MVP 2 (receipts, change requests,
dashboards) is next. The latest full audit lives in `docs/AUDIT-2026-07.md`.

## UX/UI overhaul (July 2026 design review) — implemented, keep consistent

Direction agreed after a live walkthrough and shipped on `feature/ux-overhaul`.
When touching the UI, keep these invariants:

1. **Bottom navigation bar** (Calendar / Chat / Expenses / Settings) is the top-level
   navigation — see `presentation/navigation/BottomNavDestination.kt`. It shows only on
   those four routes (`BottomNavDestination.topLevelRoutes`); detail screens hide it and
   keep an up-arrow. Budgets open from an Expenses top-bar action. Settings, reached as a
   tab, passes `onNavigateUp = null` (no back arrow). `QuickActionsBottomSheet` was dead
   code and is gone.
2. **Toolchain**: compileSdk/targetSdk 36, Kotlin 2.1 (+ `kotlin.plugin.compose`),
   Compose BOM 2025.10 (Material 3 1.4 / M3 Expressive), Room 2.7.2 (2.6.x kapt breaks on
   Kotlin 2.x metadata), Navigation 2.9.3, Hilt 2.56.2, predictive back on.
3. **Calendar**: month view is a classic grid from the 1st with horizontal month paging
   (kizitonwose `HorizontalCalendar`); day/week use `HorizontalPager` with fling physics.
   Event chips are single-line (`softWrap = false` + ellipsis). School vacation is a thin
   bottom strip, never a full-cell fill (it used to drown custody colors).
4. **Custody coloring** must go through the unified lookup in `CalendarScreen`
   (`getCustody`): active `CustodyModel` first, legacy `CustodyScheduleEntity` as fallback.
   Don't read the legacy schedules directly in a view — model-based custody would vanish.
5. **Event tap opens a preview bottom sheet** (`EventPreviewSheet`, details + Edit/Delete);
   the editor is the second step. The event form has a sticky bottom Save button.
6. **Color semantics**: Mom-pink/Dad-blue are parent identity ONLY, applied via
   `CoPlanlyColors.MomPink/DadBlue` directly. The theme's `secondary` slot is a neutral
   indigo (`CoPlanlyColors.Neutral*`), so generic Material selected states (FilterChips)
   are neutral — never wire pink through `colorScheme.secondary`.
7. **Notification permission** is requested contextually via
   `rememberNotificationPermissionRequester()` (push toggle, reminder selection), never on
   cold start.
8. **Destructive list actions** use M3 `SwipeToDismissBox` with an Undo snackbar
   (see `EventListScreen`); Undo re-creates the captured event (id is preserved).
   Danger actions (e.g. "Sign out of app") live at the bottom of their screen, not
   mid-list.
9. **User-facing strings** live in tracked, feature-named `res/values/*_strings.xml`
   files (`chat_strings.xml`, `expenses_strings.xml`, `settings_account_strings.xml`,
   `navigation.xml`, `event_preview.xml`), never in the gitignored `strings.xml`.
   Some keys already exist in the local `strings.xml`; pick distinct names in the
   tracked files (e.g. `settings_gcal_enable_sync`) so a fresh clone still builds.

DB note: installs older than the migration chain (schema < v5) are wiped via
`fallbackToDestructiveMigrationFrom(1,2,3,4)` in `DatabaseModule` — a v3 install used to
crash with "migration from 3 to 9 required but not found".

## Build & verify

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug          # main build — run after every code change
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # JVM unit tests (MockK + coroutines-test + Turbine)
./gradlew lint detekt            # static analysis (detekt config in app/config/detekt)
```

- Windows dev machine; Gradle wrapper works from Git Bash and PowerShell.
- `google-services.json` is required for the Google Services plugin, but the build
  degrades gracefully if it is missing (see the conditional apply in `app/build.gradle.kts`).
- No GitHub CI: builds and tests are run locally
  (`./gradlew clean assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest`). After switching branches,
  prefer `clean` — stale Hilt/kapt stubs from another branch cause errors like
  "Could not find class file for '…Application'".

## Hard project rules

- **Jetpack Compose only** — never add XML layouts.
- **Stateless composables** — state lives in ViewModels (`StateFlow`), UI receives values
  and callbacks. Follow the existing `UiState` sealed-class pattern.
- **Hilt** for all DI. New modules go to `app/src/main/java/com/coparently/app/di/`.
- **minSdk = 26** — beware of newer `java.time` additions
  (e.g. `LocalDate.ofInstant` is API 34+; use `Instant.atZone(...).toLocalDate()`).
- **KDoc** on public classes/functions; code and comments in **English**.
- Material 3 components; theme tokens from `presentation/theme/`
  (`CoPlanlyColors`, `Typography`, `CoPlanlyShapes`, `dimensions()`).
- Parent color semantics are product-level: **Mom = pink, Dad = blue** — do not repurpose.
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).

## Architecture map

```
domain/    — models, repository interfaces, use cases, holidays, ReminderScheduler
data/      — Room (v9 + migrations), Firestore/Google/AI clients, repository impls, sync
presentation/ — Compose screens per feature + ViewModels + theme
di/        — Hilt modules (Database, Firebase, Google, UseCase, Notification, …)
```

Data flow: UI → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository → Room (source of truth) → Firestore sync.

### Things that are easy to get wrong

1. **Room schema changes** require: entity change → version bump in `CoPlanlyDatabase` →
   migration in `DatabaseMigrations` (it is auto-registered via `ALL_MIGRATIONS`).
   Exported schemas live in `app/schemas/`.
2. **Event editing must preserve fields.** `AddEditEventScreen` keeps a snapshot of the
   loaded event and uses `copy()`. Never rebuild an `Event` from scratch on save —
   that wipes `sharedWith`/`permissions`/`createdByFirebaseUid` (this was a real bug).
3. **Private events (`isPrivate`)** must never be written to Firestore. Both
   `EventRepositoryImpl` and `SyncService` filter them — keep any new sync path consistent.
4. **Recurring events** are stored once and expanded to occurrences at query time via
   `RecurrenceExpander` (wired in `EventRepositoryImpl.getEventsByDateRange`).
   Occurrences share the master event id — don't use the id as a unique list key.
5. **The Firestore document schema for events** is defined in one place:
   `EventRepositoryImpl.toFirestoreMap()`. `SyncService` maps must stay in sync with it.
6. **Calendar query ranges** come from `queryRangeFor()` in `CalendarScreen.kt` —
   extend that function instead of inlining new range math.
7. **View modes** are `MONTH, WEEK, DAY` (roadmap order). There is no 3-day view anymore.
8. **Czech holidays** come from `domain/holidays/CzechHolidays` (pure, computed; Easter
   via computus). School vacations are the nationwide MŠMT ones; the district-dependent
   spring break is intentionally not included.
9. **Reminders** are scheduled through the `ReminderScheduler` domain interface
   (WorkManager impl `EventReminderScheduler`), hooked into the event use cases —
   schedule on create/update, cancel on delete.

## Known issues / do not "fix" silently

- `firestore.rules` (strict) currently **rejects the app's own event writes** (exact-key
  validation + timestamp type vs ISO strings). `firestore.rules.simple` is the permissive
  variant. Aligning the strict rules with the real schema is an open task — see audit §2.3.
- **All `strings.xml` files are gitignored** (they hold OAuth values locally), so a fresh
  clone has no string resources and cannot build — see audit §2.1. New string resources
  must go into separately named, tracked files (e.g. `reminders.xml`), never into
  `strings.xml`. Real secrets belong in `gradle.properties`/env vars like `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Multi-day events are only matched by their start date in `EventDao` range queries
  (audit §3.5).
- Unit tests for ChildInfo/Pairing/Settings/Sync ViewModels were removed as stale
  (they targeted long-gone APIs); rewrite them against the current constructors when
  touching those features.
