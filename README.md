## Overview

**CoPlanly** is a shared-calendar app for divorced or separately living parents. Both parents
see one custody calendar, coordinate events around the child, confirm pickups, track expenses,
chat, and keep medical/school records in one place — with offline-first local storage and
Firebase sync between the two households.

### Key features

- 🗓 **Custody calendar** — Month / Week / Day views, custody model setup (including %-based
  splits), pink/blue color coding for Mom/Dad days
- 👥 **Parent views** — switch between "Mom", "Dad" and the mutual "Both" view
- 🏷 **Event types & filters** — default types (general, medical, school, sports, birthday),
  user-defined types, and per-type visibility filters (e.g. hide school events in July)
- 🔁 **Recurring events** — daily / weekly / biweekly / monthly with an optional end date
- ✅ **Pickup confirmation** — one parent confirms the pickup, the other side sees it
- ⏰ **Reminders** — local notifications 30 min or 1 h before an event
- 🇨🇿 **Czech holidays** — public holidays (computed for any year) and national school
  vacations shown directly in the calendar, with a toggle
- 🔒 **Private events** — events only you can see; they never leave your device
- 🔄 **Sync** — two-way Google Calendar sync + Firestore sync between parents
- 💬 **Chat**, 💰 **expense tracking** with on-device receipt OCR, 🏥 **child records**
  including a medical profile, 🐾 **pet records**, 👵 **guest and calendar-friend access**
- 🌍 **Localization** — English, Czech, German, Russian, Ukrainian; light & dark themes

> **No AI features.** An AI subsystem used to sit in the tree — ~3,200 lines across
> `domain/usecase/ai`, `data/remote/ai` and `presentation/ai` — reachable from no navigation
> graph, while the Gemini key shipped in every APK. The README advertised it as a feature until
> the August 2026 audit; it was deleted in **MON-7** rather than left half-alive. The reasoning,
> and what to build if AI returns, is in `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` §6 — and if it returns it goes
> behind the Cloud Function proxy (**SEC-1**), never with a key in the client.
>
> See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for everything left to build, fix or decide — release blockers,
> security, code quality, UI/UX and monetisation, each item with a stable id and a priority.

## Roadmap status

**✅ MVP 1 — Foundation & Core Calendar (complete)**
Custody model setup, Month→Week→Day views, Mom/Both/Dad view switch, custom event types
with filters, recurrence, pickup confirmation, event reminders, Czech holidays & school
vacations, private events, weekend colors.

**🚧 MVP 2 — Communication, Receipts & Dashboards (next)**
Receipts, change requests on events, weekly summary dashboard, first-screen feed of the
last 5 changes, structured chat change-requests, image attachments.

**🎨 UX/UI overhaul — July 2026 (shipped on `feature/ux-overhaul`)**
Based on a full design review of the live app:

- **Bottom navigation bar** (Calendar / Chat / Expenses / Settings) — the chat, expense
  and budget screens previously had no entry point in the UI
- **Toolchain upgrade**: compile/target SDK 36, Kotlin 2.1, Compose BOM 2025.10,
  Material 3 1.4 (M3 Expressive), Room 2.7.2, predictive back
- **Calendar core**: `HorizontalPager` swipes with follow-the-finger physics, classic
  month grid starting at the 1st (horizontal month paging), single-line event chips,
  visible Mom/Dad custody coloring (unified `CustodyModel`-first lookup), subtle
  vacation strip
- **Event interactions**: tap opens a preview bottom sheet (details + Edit/Delete),
  sticky Save button in the event form, `SwipeToDismissBox` + Undo in the event list,
  more reminder options (10 min → 1 day), contextual notification-permission request
- **Color semantics**: neutral (indigo) selected chips; Mom-pink/Dad-blue reserved for
  parent identity only
- **Settings polish**: destructive "Sign out" moved to the bottom, push toggle reflects
  the real OS permission, hardcoded chat/expense/settings strings moved into tracked
  resource files, clearer dark-theme vacation marker
- **Fixes surfaced by the review**: Room destructive fallback for pre-v5 installs
  (v3 → v9 crash)

**🔮 MVP 3 — Automation & Integrations**
Bakaláři/Edupage import, payments, CSV/PDF exports, intelligent suggestions,
minute-precision drag resizing.

See [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) §2 for the full feature matrix and what each line
actually resolved to in the code.
