/**
 * CQ-3 — a deletion that the co-parent can actually receive.
 *
 * A delete used to be `document().delete()`, and a deleted document is not a fact anybody can
 * be told: the downstream half of the sync only ever inserted, so the other parent kept the
 * cancelled event forever. A delete is now a **tombstone** — the document survives and gains
 * `deletedAtMillis`, which reaches the co-parent through the same query that delivers every
 * other change.
 *
 * That turns a `delete` into an `update`, so the rules that decide who may delete are no longer
 * the `allow delete` clauses. These tests pin what actually governs it now, in both directions:
 * that the tombstone can be written by the people who could already delete, that it *cannot* be
 * written by anyone else, and — the part with no equivalent before — that a tombstoned document
 * is still readable, because a deletion nobody may read is a deletion nobody is told about.
