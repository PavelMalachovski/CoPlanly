## Summary answers

| Question | Answer | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? | **Yes** | |
| Is all data encrypted in transit? | **Yes** | Firebase SDKs use TLS throughout |
| Is data encrypted at rest on the device? | **Yes, for the app's database** | Room opens through SQLCipher; the passphrase is wrapped by an Android Keystore key (SEC-2). The Firebase SDK's offline cache and Coil's image cache are plaintext files under Android's file-based encryption only — the privacy policy says so (September 2026). Play does not ask this question — the row is here because the privacy policy makes the claim and something has to say what backs it |
| Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted? | **Yes** | Settings → Account → Delete account, backed by the `deleteAccount` callable |
| Is data collection required, or can users choose? | **Required** for the account and shared content; **optional** for the medical profile, photos, Google Calendar, and — since REL-5 — analytics and crash reporting |
| Have you committed to Play's Families policy? | {{DECIDE}} — the app is for parents, not children, and offers no child accounts |

## Data types

"Shared" in Play's sense means sent to a third party. The co-parent is not a third party for
this purpose — they are another user of the same account family — but transfers to Google as
our processor are declared.

| Data type | Collected | Shared | Optional | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Yes | No | No | Account management, app functionality |
| Email address | Yes | No | No | Account management, invitations |
| User IDs | Yes | No | No | Account management |
| Photos | Yes | No | Yes | App functionality — receipts, event images, medical and pet photos |
| Calendar events | Yes | No | No | App functionality |
| Messages (in-app) | Yes | No | No | App functionality |
| Health info | Yes | No | Yes | App functionality — the child's medical profile |
| Purchase/financial info | Yes | No | Yes | App functionality — shared expenses and budgets. **Not** payment data: the app processes no payments |
| App interactions | Yes | No | **Yes** | Analytics — consent-gated since REL-5 |
| Crash logs | Yes | No | **Yes** | Diagnostics — consent-gated since REL-5 |
| Diagnostics | Yes | No | **Yes** | Diagnostics — consent-gated since REL-5 |
| Approximate/precise location | **No** | — | — | Re-checked: the manifest declares only INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, POST_NOTIFICATIONS and CAMERA, and no location API is called |
| Contacts | **No** | — | — | Re-checked: `ContactsContract` appears nowhere; an emergency contact is typed by hand |
| Payment info | **No** | — | — | No billing exists yet — **revisit when it does** |

## Notes worth writing into the declaration

**Health data.** The child's medical profile is the most sensitive thing the app holds:
allergies, medications, conditions, blood group, vaccinations, notes, and photographs of
documents. It is optional, entered by a parent, and readable only by the two parents and by
guests they explicitly invite for a limited time. Declare it as **Health info → collected,
optional**.

**Photos are stored under unguessable paths, not access-controlled ones.** Cloud Storage rules
cannot read Firestore, so a photograph's URL is protected by being unguessable rather than by
a rule that knows who a parent is. This is documented at length in `storage.rules`. It does
not change the declaration, but it is the honest state of the control and should be fixed
before this ships (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`, **SEC-1**).

**Receipt OCR is on-device.** ML Kit's bundled model recognises receipt text without the
photograph or the text leaving the device. Nothing about it is collected or shared, and it is
worth saying so in the listing — it is a genuine differentiator in this category.

**Private events never leave the device.** Events marked private are excluded from every sync
path. They are not collected in Play's sense.

**Analytics and crash reporting are optional, and off until asked** (REL-5, shipped). Three
things now have to be true at once before either SDK collects anything, and this is what the
declaration should say:

1. Both auto-initialise **switched off**: `firebase_analytics_collection_enabled` and
   `firebase_crashlytics_collection_enabled` are `false` in the manifest, so nothing is collected
   in the window between process start and the app applying an answer.
2. The user has answered **yes** on the first-run screen, which is shown before sign-in and is
   changeable afterwards in Settings → App. An unanswered or declined state collects nothing.
3. The build allows it — release only, as of the August 2026 audit; debug builds never report
   whatever was answered.

**Declare both as optional, not required**, and declare the answer as changeable. The relevant
Play data types are *Crash logs* and *Diagnostics* / *App interactions* under App activity — all
"Collected, not shared", "Optional", purpose: Analytics and App functionality.

**No advertising, no ad IDs, no tracking.** The app declares no advertising SDK and does not
link data to third-party identifiers.

**AI.** No user data reaches a generative model today: the AI screens are not reachable from
navigation. **If any AI feature ships, this declaration must be revisited**, because the
prompts would carry calendar contents and message text to a third party.
