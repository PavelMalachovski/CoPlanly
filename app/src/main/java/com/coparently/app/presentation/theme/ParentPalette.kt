/**
 * A colour a parent may choose for themselves.
 *
 * **The colour stopped being derived from the slot** (owner decision, Aug 2026). It used to be:
 * slot 1 pink, slot 2 blue, with pairing deciding who got which. That was already arbitrary —
 * nobody picks a slot — and it breaks outright once a person co-parents with two others, because
 * the same person can hold slot 1 in one family and slot 2 in the other, so their own events
 * would change colour as they switched families.
 *
 * So the colour is a property of the *person*, stored on their profile as
 * [com.coparently.app.domain.model.User.colorCode] — the field has existed all along and is
 * finally used for what it is named — and each parent picks their own.
 *
 * **Nothing stores a gender, and that is the point.** A man picking blue and a woman picking
 * pink gets the outcome that was asked for; two men simply pick differently. There is no special
 * case in the code, no inference to get wrong, and no new personal data to declare in the privacy
 * policy — for a field whose only use is deciding which dot is whose.
 *
 * The slot is untouched and keeps every job it has: `parentOwner`, custody, `momDayIndices`, the
 * Firestore schema. Only the *colour* stopped reading it.
 *
 * Each entry carries three tones for the reason `ParentColors` documents at length: the full
 * strength hue is **fill-only** — no entry here clears 4.5:1 as a foreground in both themes — so
 * text needs the theme-aware `light`/`dark` partner instead.
 *
 * @property storedCode The hex written to `users/{uid}.colorCode`. Stable: it is a stored value
 *   two devices compare, so an entry is never re-lettered.
 * @property fill The hue at full strength, for dots, bars, borders and custody tints.
 * @property light The text-grade tone on a dark surface.
 * @property dark The text-grade tone on a light surface.
 * @property labelRes What the picker calls it. A name and not a swatch alone, because a colour
 *   with no label is unusable to anyone who cannot tell two of them apart — and because a
 *   screen reader has nothing else to announce.
