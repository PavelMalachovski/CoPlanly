/**
 * The two parents of this family, as this device knows them.
 *
 * Either side may be null and the two nulls mean different things: a null [me] can be an
 * account with no Room profile row at all — [UserRepositoryImpl][com.coparently.app.data.repository.UserRepositoryImpl]
 * never writes one for such an account, so [me] then stays null forever, not just until the
 * next emission — and a null [coParent] is nobody paired *or* a co-parent whose slot is not
 * known. Neither is ever filled in by inference — see [parentLabel]. Use [loaded] to tell "we
 * have a real answer, and it happens to be null" from "we have not asked yet".
 *
 * [isPaired] exists because [coParent] alone cannot answer "is there someone to choose between":
 * a legacy pair (paired before slot assignment shipped) has a real co-parent and a null
 * [coParent], since [PartnerSummary.role][com.coparently.app.domain.model.PartnerSummary.role]
 * is null until their document carries one. A screen that gates a two-person control on
 * `coParent != null` hides it from exactly that population — the pairs this app's slot
 * migration exists to serve — rather than from the family of one it was meant for.
 *
 * @property me The signed-in parent.
 * @property coParent The paired co-parent.
 * @property isPaired Whether this account is linked to a co-parent at all, independent of
 *   whether that co-parent's slot is known yet. Read the pairing state directly for this —
 *   never infer it from `coParent != null`.
 * @property loaded Whether this is a real answer rather than the synthetic starting value.
 *
 *   False only before [ParentsSource]'s upstream has emitted once. It is not "we know who both
 *   parents are": [me] can be null in a loaded answer forever, for an account with no Room
 *   profile row. A control that appears and then vanishes is worse than one that appears late,
 *   so anything that *hides* itself once the answer arrives waits on this.

 * them starts labelling the calendar differently from the other and nothing in the type system
 * notices. Five ViewModels expose `parents` and all five get it from here.
 *
 * The two halves come from different places because the app stores them differently:
 *
 * - **[me]** is a real Room row, matched *by uid* against [UserRepository.observeCurrentUserId].
 *   Never "the only row": [UserRepository.deleteUser] is called from nowhere and sign-out does
 *   not clear Room, so a device where two accounts have signed in over time holds two rows and
 *   picking either by position would name the calendar after a stranger.
 * - **[coParent]** comes from the pairing listener's [PartnerSummary][com.coparently.app.domain.model.PartnerSummary],
 *   which reads their `users/{uid}` document directly. Room never stores a row for the other
 *   parent, which is why [UserRepository.getAllUsers] alone cannot answer this question.

    /**
     * The shared upstream. **Every subscriber gets this one flow**, which is what makes the
     * `@Singleton` mean anything.
     *
     * Without sharing, each collector stood up its own copy — and this is not a cheap flow to
     * duplicate. [PairingRepository.observePairingState] attaches *three* Firestore snapshot
     * listeners per subscription and calls `loadPartner()` — a one-shot `users/{partnerId}`
     * read — inside its combine transform, so it re-fetches the partner document on every
     * emission of any of the three. With five ViewModels exposing `parents`, opening the
     * Calendar tab alone used to stand up two more full subscriptions on top of Home's.
     *
     * `WhileSubscribed` rather than `Eagerly`: when every screen has gone away there is no
     * reason to keep Firestore listeners attached. `replay = 1` so a screen opening later gets
     * the last real answer instead of a synthetic "nobody is known yet" — but only while the
     * upstream is still the *same account's* upstream. `replayExpirationMillis = 0` drops that
     * replay cache the instant the last subscriber leaves and [STOP_TIMEOUT_MS] elapses,
     * instead of the default `Long.MAX_VALUE`, which never drops it. Without this, the first
     * collector on the next signed-in account — right after a sign-out, before this singleton's
     * upstream has re-emitted anything for the new account — would be served the *previous*
     * account's [Parents] for a frame: their names, and their `roleByUid`, which feeds the
     * expense balance. Room is not cleared on sign-out either, so nothing else would catch it.
     *
     * The cost of that fix: a screen that re-subscribes more than [STOP_TIMEOUT_MS] after the
     * last one left (a cold re-entry into the Calendar tab, say) now starts from a synthetic
     * "nobody is known yet" every time, not only right after install. Callers that show UI while
     * [Parents.me] is null already have to handle it — a fresh process starts from exactly that
     * state — so this only widens how often that path is taken, not the set of states a caller
     * must handle.
     *
     * `by lazy` so that merely *constructing* this singleton does not reach for the pairing
     * repository. Nothing subscribes at construction either way — the underlying flows are cold
     * — but [signedInSlot] callers have no business touching the pairing side at all, and an
     * eager initialiser made that impossible to state or to test.
