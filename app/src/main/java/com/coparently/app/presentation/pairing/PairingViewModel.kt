     * user only when the two genuinely disagree.
     *
     * The order is the sharpest thing on this branch. `CustodyModel.momDayIndices` means "the
     * days slot 1 has custody", so an accepter moved from slot 1 to slot 2 owns a pattern that
     * has silently started describing the *co-parent's* days. Complementing it is what keeps it
     * meaning "my days" — and it has to happen **before** the comparison, or the screen offers
     * the accepter their own schedule inverted, they reject it, and hand over exactly the days
     * they meant to keep.
     *
     * **The complement is computed and persisted first — above the wait, above the read, above
     * everything that can block, fail or be cancelled — and it is not a decision.** It
     * re-expresses the same arrangement for this device's new slot, so it is written through
     * [CustodyModelRepository.saveReslotted] — locally, keeping its dates — whether the two
     * patterns then turn out to agree, disagree, or be unknowable. It depends on nothing the rest
     * of this method produces: [slotChanged] comes from the callable and `mine` is a Room read.
     *
     * Ordering it after [awaitPairingVisibleLocally] and [CustodyModelRepository.readShared] —
     * a five-second wait and an untimed Firestore `get()` — put the one write that must not be
     * lost behind both, in a coroutine [withSlotReslot] detaches and `launchAction` has already
     * stopped showing as busy. Popping the Pairing entry, the natural next tap once "Paired"
     * appears, cancels that scope; and nothing retries, because [ParentSlotMigrator.reslot] has
     * already advanced the slot marker, so `reslotIfSlotChanged` sees no change on any later
     * sync. A skipped complement is not a deferred reconciliation: it is the accepter's own
     * custody days assigned to their co-parent, on their own calendar, permanently, with nothing
     * to say so.
     *
     * Running it first also puts it **before `partnerId` reaches Room**, which is what
     * `CustodyModelRepository.observePair()` keys the shared listener on. The mirror re-pushes a
     * local model it considers newer than the document, and a pre-pairing local model usually is
     * newer — so with the old order the pattern it republished over the co-parent's was the
     * *un-complemented* one, and the echo came back carrying the same preserved instant
     * the complemented row holds, so `isNewer` was false and the mirror wrote it into Room. Both
     * phones then settled on the inverted schedule, with no banner for the accepter because
     * `lastModifiedBy` was their own uid.
     *
     * Deferring the complement to the conflict screen was wrong for a related reason: the pending
     * prompt lives only in memory, so process death or leaving the screen before the event is
     * collected would leave Room holding the un-complemented pattern, still active.
     *
     * The shared document is read once the complement is safe, and its pattern is then carried by
     * value: the mirror may replace it seconds later. Whatever the user picks is written last,
     * and last write wins.
     *
     * **Only one write from here reaches Firestore**, and only when the read *proved* the pair has
     * no document. Everything else is left to the mirror, which settles Room and the document
     * against each other by the last-write-wins rule the rest of custody sync already runs on.
     * Re-stamping a pattern here would make this device win that comparison forever.
     *
     * A failure is logged and swallowed, exactly as in [reslotIfChanged]: the pairing has already
     * committed server-side and cannot be retried, so a Room or Firestore error here must fail
     * the reconciliation, not the pairing that did not fail.
     *
     * @param slotChanged Whether pairing actually moved this device to the other slot. False for
     *   the rare accept that keeps the slot, where the stored pattern already means "my days".
     * @param mySlot The slot pairing has just assigned to this device, as reported by the
