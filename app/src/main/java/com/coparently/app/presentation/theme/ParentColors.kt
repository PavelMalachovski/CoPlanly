/**
 * Parent identity colours, resolved for the theme that is actually being painted.
 *
 * A colour identifies a *parent*, not a role: the app no longer shows the words Mom and Dad,
 * and `"mom"`/`"dad"` survive only as slot identifiers assigned by pairing. Which person holds
 * which slot is decided in `functions/index.js` (`assignSlots`) and shown by name everywhere
 * else — see `presentation/common/ParentLabels.kt`.
 *
 * **Which colour a slot draws in is no longer fixed.** Each parent chooses their own
 * ([ParentColorChoice]), and the family's two answers arrive here as a [ParentPalette]. The
 * default is the pink and blue the app has always used, so a call site that does not have the
 * parents to hand — and a family where nobody has chosen — looks exactly as it did.
 *
 * `CoPlanlyColors.MomPink`/`DadBlue` are **fill-only** — neither clears 4.5:1 as a foreground
 * in either theme — so any screen that wants to write a parent's name in pink has to reach for
 * the theme-aware `*Light`/`*Dark` partner instead. Three screens (home dashboard, calendar
 * ribbon, expenses split) need that choice, and the luminance test behind it was already
 * copy-pasted into `MonthView` and `DayWeekView`. These helpers are the one place that decision
 * lives.
 *
 * The saturation rule is unchanged: a custody day background is the hue at ~14% alpha, a chip
 * or dot is the same hue at full strength.
 *
 * The test is on `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surface.luminance()`, never `isSystemInDarkTheme()`:
 * the in-app theme setting can force light while the system is dark, and the colour has to
 * follow what is actually on screen.
