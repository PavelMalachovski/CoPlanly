/**
 * A day cell's fills: the [base] it starts from, the [overlay] drawn over it, and — on a day the
 * child changes hands — the parent the day is coming *from*.
 *
 * @property base Always decided by the weekday alone, so the weekend band is continuous.
 * @property overlay The cell's meaning — custody, holiday or today — or [DayCellOverlay.NONE].
 * @property handoverFrom The parent who had the child *yesterday*, when the child changes hands
 *   on this cell's morning; null on every other day. Only ever [DayCellOverlay.CUSTODY_MOM] or
 *   [DayCellOverlay.CUSTODY_DAD]. It is a **shape**, not a fourth colour: the cell is split on a
 *   diagonal with this parent in the top-left and [overlay]'s parent in the bottom-right, so the
 *   weekend base still shows through both halves and this file's invariant survives. Reserved
 *   for **pattern** boundaries: a day decided by an accepted one-off swap (and the day after it)
 *   renders as a single solid fill instead — an owner decision from the Aug 2026 walkthrough,
 *   where the split read as "the swap only half-happened".
 * @property pendingProposalFor The parent a **pending, unanswered** custody proposal would give
 *   this day to, when that differs from whose day it is now; null on every other day. Only ever
 *   [DayCellOverlay.CUSTODY_MOM] or [DayCellOverlay.CUSTODY_DAD]. It is drawn *over* [overlay],
 *   at a lower alpha, so the agreed pattern keeps its full strength underneath: a proposal is a
 *   preview, and a grid that showed only the proposal would tell a parent their days had changed
 *   when they had not. The two translucent hues do blend into something that is neither parent's
 *   colour, and that is the intended reading — the day is being argued about. The cell's spoken
 *   description says so in words, which is what actually disambiguates it.
 * @property isAdjacentMonth Whether this cell is one of the leading or trailing days borrowed
 *   from a neighbouring month. It is a **fact about the day, not a colour**: the caller draws the
 *   same fills at a reduced strength, the way the day number and the event dots are already
 *   dimmed. Encoded here rather than left to the view so that every consequence of a day being
 *   borrowed is decided in this file, which is the whole point of it.
 * @property schoolVacation Whether the day falls in a school vacation (MON-13). It is a **line,
 *   not a fill**: a thin neutral hairline along the cell's bottom edge, in the theme's `outline`
 *   role, drawn over every other layer and taking no height. Not a colour channel — pink and blue
 *   are the parents, teal is a calendar friend, grey is the weekend, red is a public holiday — and
 *   not a tint, because a summer break covers every cell of July and August and the teal strip that
 *   used to do this was removed for washing a whole month. It crosses into the borrowed days like
 *   the custody band does: a vacation is a run of days, and a run that stops mid-row is the defect
 *   that band was fixed for. Nothing on it can be acted on, so it has none of the reasons the
 *   holiday tint has to stop at the month's edge.

/**
 * Decides what a calendar day cell is filled with, kept out of Compose so the branching can be
 * unit tested without a composition.
 *
 * **The weekend is a base, not a competitor.** The month cell used to pick exactly one
 * background, with custody ahead of the weekend; because
 * [com.coparently.app.domain.model.CustodyModel.getCustodyFor] reduces any date into the pattern
 * cycle and always answers `"mom"` or `"dad"`, every in-month cell matched a custody branch and
 * the weekend branch could not be reached at all. The only weekends that kept a tint were the
 * ones belonging to a neighbouring month, which is why the band appeared in some grid rows and
 * not others with no rule a reader could infer.
 *
 * Weekend deliberately does **not** win over custody: weekends are the days a separated parent
 * checks first, and replacing the parent hue there with grey would remove the answer from exactly
 * the cells the screen exists to give it in.
 *
 * **Every case a cell can be in is decided here, in one place**: weekend base, custody overlay,
 * public holiday, today, the handover diagonal, the pending-proposal preview and the
 * school-vacation line. Two functions
 * that each knew some of the cases is precisely how the weekend band became unreachable, so a new
 * case folds in rather than growing a second decision beside this one. (Pending *swap* arrows are
 * the deliberate exception: they are a glyph, not a fill, and `MonthView` draws them from a set of
 * dates — a swap changes nothing about whose day it is, so it has no business in a colour.)

     *   arrows — because those mark a day you would do something about, and a borrowed cell
     *   refuses every gesture.

     *   Any other value is treated as no custody rather than guessed at.
     * @param previousCustody Whose day *yesterday* was, resolved through the same lookup. When it
     *   differs from [custody] the child changes hands on this cell's morning, and the cell is
     *   split diagonally — see [DayCellFill.handoverFrom].
     * @param isPublicHoliday A public holiday, not a school vacation — school vacation is never a
     *   cell fill.
     * @param proposedCustody Whose day this would be under a **pending** custody proposal, or
     *   null when nothing is pending. Resolved from the proposal's own pattern, never from the
     *   agreed one. See [pendingProposal].
     * @param isSwapped Whether an **accepted** one-off swap decides this day. A swapped day is a
     *   whole day in the other parent's care, so it renders as one solid fill — the diagonal
     *   would say the swap only half-happened. The custody lookup already resolves *whose* day it

     *   this cell would otherwise inherit from the swap's far edge, for the same reason.

     *   inside one too, which is why it is its own input and not read off the day's `Holiday`.
