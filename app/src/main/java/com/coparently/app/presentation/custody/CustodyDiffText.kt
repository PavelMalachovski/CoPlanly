/**
 * Turns a [CustodyPatternDiff] into the two lines a parent reads before answering a proposal.
 *
 * In composable scope rather than in the ViewModel for the usual reason: the diff is slots and
 * counts, and only here is there a `Context` to resolve five locales and a [ParentNames] to turn
 * `"mom"`/`"dad"` into the people they are.
 *
 * @param diff What the proposal would change, or null while nothing has resolved.
 * @param parentNames Resolves a slot to that parent's name.
 * @return The description, or null when there is nothing honest to say — no diff yet, or a
 *   pattern the app could not read. Callers fall back to the plain "a new schedule was
 *   proposed" wording rather than printing a confident "nothing changes".
