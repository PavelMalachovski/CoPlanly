 * month wins, never *how* it gets there — and Expenses now changes month over the same duration
 * and easing, so paging feels like one gesture in one app rather than two screens that happen to
 * have months.
 *
 * Deliberately shared rather than copied: the value that matters here is not 500 in particular,
 * it is that both places use the *same* number. Two constants half a codebase apart drift the
 * first time somebody tunes one of them.

 *
 * When the month has **not** changed the answer is no transition at all. That case is not
 * hypothetical: the content also changes when an expense is added, deleted or restored by Undo,
 * and sliding there would announce a page turn that never happened.
 *
 * Built through the [ContentTransform] constructor rather than the `togetherWith … using` infix
 * pair: `using` is not part of this Compose version's animation API, and naming the size transform
 * as an argument says the same thing without depending on which infix helpers happen to exist.
