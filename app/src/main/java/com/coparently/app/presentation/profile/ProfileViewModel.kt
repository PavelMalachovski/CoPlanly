/**
 * Backs [ProfileScreen][com.coparently.app.presentation.profile.ProfileScreen] in both of its
 * modes: editing the signed-in user's own record, and displaying the co-parent's read-only.
 *
 * [me] and [coParent] are resolved differently because the app stores them differently — the
 * same split [com.coparently.app.presentation.common.ParentsSource] documents for its own
 * `Parents` type:
 * - **[me]** comes from Room, keyed by [UserRepository.observeCurrentUserId] so a sign-in,
 *   sign-out or account switch reloads it. For each identity, [observeMe] waits on
 *   [UserRepository.observeUserById] only until its **first** non-null row, then stops
 *   collecting — it does not stay subscribed for the rest of the screen's lifetime. That one
 *   difference matters both ways: waiting (rather than a single [UserRepository.getUserById]
 *   read) is what lets a screen opened in the window between sign-in and
 *   [UserRepository.ensureProfile]'s asynchronous write still receive the row once it lands,
 *   instead of leaving [me] null forever; stopping after that first row is what stops a save
 *   this ViewModel itself just made, or an unrelated background sync, from clobbering an
 *   in-progress edit — the exact shape of the `ChildInfoViewModel` bug CLAUDE.md's "Known
 *   issues" records, a screen-lifetime subscription overwriting a draft the user is mid-edit
 *   on. A row that still has not appeared after [ME_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MILLIS] sets
 *   [ProfileUiState.meUnavailable] instead of waiting forever, for the one case waiting can
 *   never resolve on its own: the name-less identity path in `ensureProfile` creates no local
 *   row at all.
 * - **[coParent]** comes from [UserRepository.getRemoteUserProfile], a direct
 *   `users/{uid}` read, once per co-parent uid reported by [PairingRepository.observePairingState] —
 *   never from [UserRepository.getAllUsers], which only ever holds a row for the signed-in
 *   user and, on a device where more than one account has signed in over time, may hold rows
 *   for accounts paired with nobody. Not extended onto
 *   [PartnerSummary][com.coparently.app.domain.model.PartnerSummary]: that model exists to
 *   name a person in a chat header, and hanging profile fields on it would load them on every
 *   screen that only wants a name.
 *
 * @param userRepository Loads and saves the signed-in user's own record, and reads the
 *   co-parent's remote one.
 * @param pairingRepository Reports which uid, if any, is the co-parent.
