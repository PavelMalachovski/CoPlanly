/**
 * The first-run question about analytics and crash reporting (REL-5).
 *
 * **It is a question, not a notice.** There is no dismiss, no "continue" that quietly means yes,
 * and the two buttons are the two answers — which is what makes it a consent rather than a
 * disclosure. Declining is the *first* of the two and carries no penalty anywhere in the app;
 * everything works identically either way, and the copy says so rather than leaving a parent to
 * wonder what they are giving up.
 *
 * **It runs before sign-in**, because both SDKs would otherwise have collected a session before
 * anyone had been asked. That is also why it is a route of its own rather than a step inside the
 * onboarding wizard: the wizard belongs to an account, and this question is older than the account.
 *
 * The answer is changeable afterwards from Settings → App, which is the other half of what makes
 * this a consent — a decision you cannot revisit is not one.
 *
 * @param onAnswered Called once the answer is stored, to leave this screen.
 * @param viewModel Stores the answer.
