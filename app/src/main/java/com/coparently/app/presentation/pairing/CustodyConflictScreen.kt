/**
 * The pairing conflict screen: two custody patterns, side by side, one action each.
 *
 * Shown only when both parents have an active pattern and the two are not equivalent — the
 * decision is [CustodyConflictResolver]'s, made the moment pairing was accepted. What arrives
 * here is already resolved in one crucial respect: this device's pattern has been complemented
 * for the slot pairing moved it to, so "my days" still means my days. Comparing before
 * complementing would show a parent their own schedule inverted.
 *
 * **There is no Back.** No up arrow, and the system gesture is swallowed. A conflict screen the
 * accepter can dismiss silently keeps whichever pattern happened to be on this phone — which is
 * the same as deciding for them, only without telling them. Two actions, one per pattern, and
 * no third exit.
 *
 * @param onResolved Leaves the screen: after a choice is written, and immediately if there is no
 *   conflict left to show (the process was restarted while it was open).
 * @param viewModel The two patterns, the two parents, and the write.
