/**
 * Today's date, as a value that actually changes when today does.
 *
 * `remember { LocalDate.now() }` is the obvious thing to write and it is wrong here: it captures
 * the date at first composition and never revisits it, so an app left open overnight goes on
 * highlighting yesterday. For a product whose entire question is *whose day is it today*, that is
 * an answer that quietly becomes wrong while the screen still looks right.
 *
 * Reading `LocalDate.now()` inline is no better on its own. It is correct whenever it runs, but
 * nothing makes it run: midnight is not a recomposition trigger. This is — the state changes, and
 * everything reading it recomposes.
 *
 * The wait is recomputed each round from the real clock rather than assuming 24 hours, so a
 * daylight-saving change, a manual clock adjustment or a delay that fires late all land on the
 * right date: whatever wakes the loop, the new value comes from `LocalDate.now()`, not from
 * counting.
 *
 * Known limitation: while the process is in Doze the timer is throttled, so the change can arrive
 * late — but it arrives with the correct date, and any screen the user actually returns to
 * recomposes with it.
