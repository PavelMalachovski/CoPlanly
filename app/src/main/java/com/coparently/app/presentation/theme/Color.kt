/**
 * Color palette for CoPlanly app.

 *
 * Every token below records **two** contrast ratios — against white (light theme) and against
 * [DarkSurface] `#1B1B21` (dark theme) — because the app ships and is used in dark, where a
 * ratio measured on white says nothing. Ratios are computed with the WCAG 2.x relative
 * luminance formula.
 *
 * Each token also states whether it is **text-grade** (may be used as a foreground colour, so
 * it must clear 4.5:1 against the surface it sits on) or **fill-only** (tints, borders, dots —
 * WCAG 1.4.3 does not apply, and using it as text is a bug). No single hue clears 4.5:1
 * against both white and `#1B1B21`, which is why the text-grade entries come in theme-aware
 * pairs. Pick between a pair with `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surface.luminance()`, never with
 * `isSystemInDarkTheme()` — the in-app theme can differ from the system one.
