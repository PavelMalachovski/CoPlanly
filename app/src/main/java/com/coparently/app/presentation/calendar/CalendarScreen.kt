 * The selection after tapping [date], kept a **consecutive** run.
 *
 * A run rather than an arbitrary set because that is what was asked for, and because one popup
 * saying "5 days" is only honest about a range a parent can see at a glance. Tapping outside the
 * current run extends it to reach the new day and fills the gap; tapping the only selected day
 * clears the selection, which is how a mis-started long-press is undone.
 *
 * Capped at [MAX_SWAP_SELECTION_DAYS]: the run is written one day at a time (Firestore Rules can
 * validate a diff naming only one date), so an unbounded selection is an unbounded number of
 * document writes on one tap. Over the cap the run is trimmed from the end nearest the tap, so
 * the day the parent just touched is always in it.
 */
/**
 * The consecutive run a drag has traced, from the day it started on to the day under the finger.
 *
 * Distinct from [toggledForSwap], which reads the *existing* run's ends and therefore only ever
 * grows: a finger that overshoots and comes back has to shorten the run, and only the anchor
 * says which end is fixed. Capped the same way and for the same reason, keeping the anchor's end
 * so the day the gesture started on never disappears from under the finger.
 *
 * @param anchor The day the long press started on.
 * @param date The day the finger is over now.
 * @return Every day from one to the other, inclusive, at most [MAX_SWAP_SELECTION_DAYS] long.
