/**
 * The four things that can happen to a custody proposal, as pure functions over [SharedCustody] —
 * kept out of the repository so the table can be tested without Firestore, Room or a coroutine,
 * the same way [CustodyChangeAnnouncement] keeps the banner's decision testable.
 *
 * Every function returns a [Result] rather than throwing or silently no-oping. A refused
 * transition is a real outcome the UI has to show ("your co-parent already has a proposal
 * waiting"), and a silent no-op would be the invisible change this whole feature exists to
 * remove.
 *
 * **A proposal write leaves the pattern, [SharedCustody.lastModifiedBy] and
 * [SharedCustody.lastModifiedAtMillis] exactly as they were.** That is not tidiness: `lastModifiedBy`
 * is what [CustodyChangeAnnouncement] compares against the reader's own uid to ignore the echo
 * of its own write, so a proposal that stamped the proposer would make the co-parent's
 * not-yet-dismissed pattern change read as the proposer's own echo and swallow its banner.
