/**
 * Domain model representing a family pet shared between the two parents.
 *
 * Mirrors [ChildInfo] deliberately: a pet moves between the two homes on the same custody
 * rhythm as the child, and the questions a sitter or a vet asks are the same shape — what
 * does it take, what must it not eat, who do I call. [Medication] and [Vaccination] are the
 * same value types the child's record uses, so one editor serves both and the two never
 * drift into different ideas of what a dose looks like.
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier for the pet
 * @property name The pet's name
 * @property species What kind of animal this is
 * @property breed Breed, or null when unknown or not applicable
 * @property dateOfBirth The pet's date of birth, or null when unknown
 * @property medications Medications the pet takes
 * @property vaccinations Vaccines given, with dates when the parent recorded them
 * @property specialNeeds Free-text traits both homes must know: behaviour, fears, allergies
 * @property feedingNotes What and when to feed, walking routine — what a handover needs
 * @property vetName Name of the veterinary clinic or vet, or null
 * @property vetPhone Phone number of the vet, or null
 * @property photos `RecordPhotoCodec` references to the pet's photographs, in the order they
 *   were added (L-4). Readable by the two parents only — never by a guest, and never through a
 *   download URL.
 * @property createdAt Timestamp when the record was created
 * @property updatedAt Timestamp when the record was last updated
 * @property createdByFirebaseUid Firebase UID of the user who created this record
 * @property lastModifiedBy Firebase UID of the user who last modified this record
 * @property syncedToFirestore Whether the record has been synced to Firestore
