/**
 * The single answer to "whose day is this?".
 *
 * CLAUDE.md already requires every view to go through one custody lookup — reading the legacy
 * `CustodyScheduleEntity` rows directly is what once made model-based custody invisible. This
 * takes over that role and joins one-off swaps into it, **inside** the lookup rather than beside
 * it, so a caller cannot accidentally consult the pattern without the overrides.
 *
 * The ordering is the whole correctness of the feature:
 *
 * 1. an **accepted** [DayOverride] for that date;
 * 2. otherwise the active [CustodyModel];
 * 3. otherwise the legacy per-parent schedule;
 * 4. otherwise null — no arrangement is recorded, and a guess would be worse than a blank cell.
 *
 * A `PENDING` or `DECLINED` override changes nothing. Letting a pending swap move a day would
 * show both parents a day neither of them agreed to, on a screen they plan around; letting the
 * pattern win over an accepted swap would do the same in the other direction.
