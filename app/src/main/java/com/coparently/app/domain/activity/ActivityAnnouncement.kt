/**
 * What happened, as a fact rather than a sentence.
 *
 * **The two parents may not read the same language.** A card composed in the sender's locale is a
 * card the recipient may not be able to read, and the sender's language is not a property of the
 * message. So an announcement carries the facts and the *reader's* device turns them into a
 * sentence, through `stringResource`, in its own language.
 *
 * This replaces `RequestChangeViewModel.postChatMessage`, which built its card by concatenating
 * hardcoded English inside a ViewModel — the class of defect CLAUDE.md tracks, and one that would
 * have filled a Russian phone's chat with English the moment it was generalised to every change.
 *
 * @property kind What happened. Each member renders as one string resource; the mapping is a
 *   `when` with no `else`, so adding a member is a compile error until it is translated.
 * @property entityType What it happened to, so a tap can route without parsing [kind].
 * @property entityId The row to open on tap.
 * @property title The entity's own name — an event's title, an expense's description. Passed as a
 *   format argument, never concatenated into the sentence, because word order differs by language.
 * @property whenIso ISO date-time the change is about, where one applies. Formatted by the reader
 *   in their own locale and zone.
 * @property amount Formatted amount for an expense, or null. Already carries its currency symbol.
 * @property currency ISO currency code, or null. Kept beside [amount] so a reader can group by it
 *   without parsing the formatted string — the app never converts between currencies.
 * @property planCitation On a `CUSTODY_PROPOSED` card only: the parenting-plan answer the proposal
 *   was built from (MON-21), as the same `PlanCitationCodec` string the custody document carries
 *   under `proposalPlanCitation`, or null. Copied here because the custody document forgets it the
 *   moment the proposal is answered, while a message is immutable — so this is what lets the
 *   export (MON-3) say which answer a proposal cited, months later. Kept verbatim, never decoded
 *   on read: a string this build cannot parse still survives a round trip through Room.
