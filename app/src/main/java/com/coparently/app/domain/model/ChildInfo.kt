/**
 * Domain model representing information about a child.
 * Stores important shared data like medications, activities, allergies, etc.
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier for the child info
 * @property childName Name of the child
 * @property dateOfBirth Child's date of birth
 * @property medications List of medications the child takes
 * @property activities List of child's activities (sports, clubs, etc.)
 * @property allergies List of known allergies
 * @property medicalNotes Additional medical notes
 * @property emergencyContacts List of emergency contact information
 * @property schoolInfo Information about the child's school
 * @property medicalProfile Emergency-relevant medical facts: blood type, intolerances,
 *   hereditary conditions and vaccinations. Defaults to an empty profile, not null.
 * @property medicalPhotos Download URLs of photographs attached to the medical notes — a
 *   prescription, a rash, a vaccination card — in the order they were added. Shared with the
 *   co-parent like the rest of this record. **Not encrypted**, and deliberately so: nothing in
 *   this app is, and a false promise about medical images would be worse than none.
 * @property guests People who may read this record without being a parent of the child, keyed
 *   by uid — a grandparent for a weekend. A guest sits beside the two-slot parent model and
 *   never occupies a slot. Being here is what makes them a *guest*; being in the document's
 *   `sharedWith` is what makes the record readable to them, and `firestore.rules` will not let
 *   the second imply write.
 * @property createdAt Timestamp when the info was created
 * @property updatedAt Timestamp when the info was last updated
 * @property createdByFirebaseUid Firebase UID of the user who created this info
 * @property lastModifiedBy Firebase UID of the user who last modified this info
 * @property syncedToFirestore Whether the info has been synced to Firestore
