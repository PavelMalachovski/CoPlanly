package com.coparently.app.domain.friends

/**
 * A trusted third person a family lets in beside the two parents — a guardian, a friend, a
 * grandparent — with their own account and their own self-authored profile.
 *
 * A friend **sits beside the two-slot parent model and never occupies a slot** (the rule
 * [com.coparently.app.domain.guests.GuestGrant] states for a child-record guest). `"mom"`/`"dad"`
 * are the two schema slot ids and are never renamed; a friend is neither, and
 * `acceptPairingInvitation` refuses a friend invitation outright so one can never become one.
 *
 * The profile is authored by the friend about themselves — the two parents read it but never
 * write it, so nobody puts words in a grandmother's mouth. [familyParents] is the pair who may
 * read it, stamped once and immutable thereafter; it is what the security rule keys the parents'
 * read on without a per-document `get()`.
 *
 * @property uid The friend's own Firebase UID — the profile document's id.
 * @property name The friend's name, as they give it. Never derived from an email.
 * @property role What they are to the family; see [FriendRole].
 * @property phones Phone numbers, in the order the friend listed them. Blank entries are dropped
 *   before storage so the UI has one thing to test for.
 * @property bloodGroup The friend's blood group, or null when they did not give one. Free text,
 *   not an enum: the field exists for somebody to read aloud in an emergency, not to validate.
 * @property photoUrl The friend's avatar. For a Google sign-in this is the account's own
 *   picture, taken from Firebase Auth the first time they save a profile and never overwritten
 *   afterwards — a friend who has set something of their own keeps it. Null for an
 *   email/password account and for a Google account with no picture; `AccountAvatar`'s
 *   initial-letter fallback covers both.
 * @property familyParents The two parent UIDs allowed to read this profile.

/**
 * A friend's live read access to one family's calendar.
 *
 * Mirrors `calendar_friends/{familyId}__{friendUid}` ([documentId]). Held centrally rather than
 * fanned out into every event's audience, so admitting or revoking a friend is one write and no
 * event document is ever rewritten — see the events read rule in `firestore.rules`.
 *
 * **One grant per family (L-5).** A grandparent admitted by two families holds two of these, one
 * each, and loses neither when the other is revoked or runs out; before L-5 the grant was keyed on
 * the friend alone and the second family's invitation silently overwrote the first.
 *
 * @property friendUid Whose access this is; the second half of the document's id.
 * @property familyId The family it opens — `FamilyKey.of(familyParents)`, the first half of the
 *   document's id, and what the events rule matches against each event's own `familyId` (M-6).
 *   Blank only in a value built by hand; the mapper drops a stored grant without one.
 * @property name The friend's display name at the time the grant was made, so a parent's
 *   "who can see this" list can name them without reading their profile.
 * @property photoUrl Their avatar at that same moment — a Google account's own picture, copied
 *   from their `users/{uid}.profilePhotoUrl` by the callable. Stored here for the same reason
 *   [name] is: the parents' list would otherwise need a second read of a document that is not
 *   theirs. Null for an account with no picture, and the initial-letter fallback covers it.
 * @property familyParents The two parents whose events the friend may read.
 * @property grantedBy Which parent admitted them. Required by the rule to be the caller.
 * @property grantedAtMillis When access began, epoch millis.
 * @property expiresAtMillis When access ends, epoch millis. Never absent and never zero — the one
 *   default this feature must not have is "forever", which is why [CalendarFriendPolicy] treats
 *   a missing value as expired rather than as unlimited.
