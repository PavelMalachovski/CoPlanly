/**
 * Repository interface for managing users.
 * Part of the domain layer in Clean Architecture.
 *
 * Over detekt's `TooManyFunctions` threshold, and deliberately so. The eleventh is
 * [observeCurrentUserId], the reactive counterpart of [getCurrentUserId]. Both are needed —
 * a suspending call site wants the snapshot, a ViewModel wants the stream, and offering
 * only the snapshot is what let `ChatViewModel` freeze a session identity in `init` and
 * leave the co-parent action dead. The twelfth is [getRemoteUserProfile]: Room holds a
 * `users` row for the signed-in user only (see that function's doc), so answering "what does
 * the co-parent's profile say" needs a distinct, Firestore-backed read rather than a variant
 * of [getUserById]. Splitting the interface to satisfy the threshold would move that
 * judgement into the type system for no benefit.
