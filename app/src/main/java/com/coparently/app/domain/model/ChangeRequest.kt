/**
 * Domain model for a proposed change to an event, sent by one parent to the other.
 *
 * The requester proposes a new start (and optionally end) time for an existing shared
 * event; the other parent can accept (the event is updated) or decline. Requests are
 * synced through Firestore so both parents see their state.
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier of the request
 * @property eventId Id of the event the change is proposed for
 * @property eventTitle Denormalized event title so dashboards can render without a join
 * @property requestedBy Firebase UID of the parent who proposed the change
 * @property requestedTo Firebase UID of the parent who must respond
 * @property currentStartDateTime Event start at the moment the request was created
 * @property currentEndDateTime Event end at the moment the request was created
 * @property proposedStartDateTime Proposed new start
 * @property proposedEndDateTime Proposed new end (null keeps the event open-ended)
 * @property note Optional free-text explanation from the requester
 * @property status Current lifecycle state of the request
 * @property createdAt When the request was created
 * @property respondedAt When the request was accepted/declined/cancelled
 * @property syncedToFirestore Whether the request has been synced to Firestore
