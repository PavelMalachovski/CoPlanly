 * @property momDayIndices Set of day indices (0-based) within the pattern when mom has custody
 * @property startDate Anchor date for calculating pattern position
 * @property isActive Whether this model is currently in use
 * @property contactWindows Parts of a cycle day spent with the parent who does not have that day
 *   (MON-6b) — "every Wednesday 15:00–19:00 with the other parent". Overlaid on the whole-day
 *   pattern, never folded into it: [getCustodyFor] ignores them, and [contactWindowsOn] is the
 *   one question they answer. See [ContactWindow].
 * @property seasonalLayers Date ranges on which another pattern replaces this one (MON-14) —
