/**
 * Expands recurring events into concrete occurrences within a date range.
 *
 * Occurrences keep the id of their master event so tapping one opens the
 * master for editing. Supported patterns: "daily", "weekly", "biweekly", "monthly".
 *
 * **Occurrences are indexed, not walked.** The nth occurrence is a pure function of the master
 * event's start and its pattern — [occurrenceAt] — and the expansion jumps straight to the first
 * index the queried range can contain. Two consequences, both of them fixes:
 *
 * 1. A range far from the event's start costs the same as a near one. The previous
 *    implementation stepped one interval at a time from `startDateTime` and stopped after
 *    [MAX_OCCURRENCES] **loop iterations**, so a *daily* event simply ceased to exist 730 days
 *    after it began: ask for a month three years out and the answer was an empty list, while the
 *    master row sat intact in Room. The calendar did not lose the event, it lied about it.
 * 2. The same occurrence lands on the same day whichever window asks for it. Walking
 *    `plusMonths(1)` repeatedly clamps *and keeps* the clamp — a monthly event on the 31st
 *    became the 28th the first time it crossed February and stayed there — so the answer
 *    depended on where the walk started. Indexing from the master start restores the 31st, and
 *    makes the window irrelevant.
