/**
 * The `coplanly://chat` link a chat-message push notification opens.
 *
 * Mirrors `PairingUri`'s real shape: `PairingUri.build(code)` carries an optional `?code=`
 * query parameter, and the pairing *push* only omits it because no code is meaningful for a
 * `pairing_accepted`/`pairing_removed` event. A chat-message push, by contrast, always knows
 * which conversation the message belongs to (`notifyOfChatMessage` in `functions/index.js`
 * puts it in the queued notification's `data`), so carrying it through here — rather than
 * leaving the client to land one screen short of the thread — is the consistent move, not a
 * parallel mechanism.
 *
 * An absent or blank id still resolves to the Chat tab's conversation list rather than
 * failing: a manual test push, an older payload, or a link typed by hand may carry none.
