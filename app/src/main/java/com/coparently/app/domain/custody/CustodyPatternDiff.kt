/**
 * What a proposed custody pattern would actually change, as data.
 *
 * The co-parent's popup used to say only that a new schedule had been proposed and who by. The
 * information to say more was already on the same document — `SharedCustody` carries the agreed
 * `model` and the pending `proposal.model` side by side — and every consumer threw the agreed
 * half away one line before the UI. This is the missing piece: a value object the screen turns
 * into a sentence.
 *
 * No strings and no `Context`: slots and dates only, like [DayOverride] and `SwapError`, so the
 * five locales resolve at the composable and the whole thing stays unit-testable.
 *
 * @property movedDays Days inside the window whose slot changes, soonest first.
 * @property netDaysBySlot Net day change per slot over the window — `{"mom": -3, "dad": +3}`.
 *   A slot with no change is absent.
 * @property windowDays How many days from the anchor were compared, so the screen can say what
 *   "3 days move" is measured over.
 * @property identical True when the two patterns assign every day the same way **and** carry the
 *   same contact windows; a proposal that changes nothing visible is worth saying out loud rather
 *   than describing as "0 days". A proposal that only moves an afternoon is not identical — saying
 *   "nothing on the calendar would change" over it would be a false sentence.
 * @property comparable False when one of the patterns could not be read — an unvalidated cycle
 *   length off the co-parent's document. The screen then falls back to the old wording rather
 *   than printing a confidently wrong "nothing changes".
 * @property contactWindowsChanged True when some day inside the window gains, loses or moves a
 *   contact window (MON-6b), whether or not any whole day moves.
 * @property seasonalLayersChanged True when the proposal adds, removes or edits a seasonal layer
 *   (MON-14). Compared on the whole list rather than over the window: a summer layer proposed in
 *   March moves nothing in the next eight weeks, and "nothing on the calendar would change" over
 *   it would be a false sentence.
