/**
 * Domain model representing an expense for a child.
 * This is the clean architecture model used in the domain layer.
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier for the expense
 * @property forMembers The children and pets this expense is about. Empty means the whole
 *   family, which is what every record written before the reference type holds — see
 *   [com.coparently.app.domain.family.FamilyMemberRef]. It replaces a single `childId`, which
 *   had nowhere to put a vet's bill.
 * @property title Title/description of the expense
 * @property amount Amount spent
 * @property currency Currency code (default: USD)
 * @property category Category of the expense
 * @property paidBy Firebase UID of the parent who paid
 * @property splitBetween List of Firebase UIDs to split the expense between
 * @property date Date of the expense
 * @property receiptUrl `RecordPhotoCodec` reference to the receipt photo, or null (L-4). The
 *   name is older than the format; it is never a download URL.
 * @property notes Optional notes about the expense
 * @property createdAt Timestamp when the expense was created
 * @property syncedToFirestore Whether the expense has been synced to Firestore
 * @property createdByFirebaseUid Who created this expense — the uid edits are gated on. Null on
 *   rows recorded before the field existed, which read as "editable by both", exactly what they
 *   were.
 * @property splitBasisPoints Slot 1's agreed share of this expense when it was recorded, in
 *   basis points; null for a row that predates the agreement.
