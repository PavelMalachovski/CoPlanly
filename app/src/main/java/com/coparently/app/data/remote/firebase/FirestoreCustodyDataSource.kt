/**
 * Reads and writes the one custody document a pair shares.
 *
 * Room stores `momDaysPattern` as a JSON string because SQLite has no array type. Firestore
 * has one, so the document carries `momDayIndices` as a real array of integers and the
 * conversion lives here: a JSON blob on the wire is opaque to a security rule and to anyone
 * reading the console.
 *
 * **This collection is read by document id only** — there is no list query here and there must
 * not be one. `CLAUDE.md` item 12 is about the opposite mistake (a list query that fails to
 * mirror the field its rule keys on), and the reflex it breeds is to add a
 * `whereArrayContains("participants", uid)` that nothing needs. `firestore.rules` grants
 * `allow get`, deliberately not `allow read`, so such a query would be rejected outright rather
 * than quietly working.
 *
 * Two other constraints of that rule shape every write below, and neither is optional:
 * `participants` must be stored pre-sorted (`participants[0] < participants[1]` is enforced on
 * create) and is compared with order-sensitive equality on update, so every write sends the
 * same sorted array; and a non-merge `set()` that omitted `participants` would be denied as an
 * evaluation error.
