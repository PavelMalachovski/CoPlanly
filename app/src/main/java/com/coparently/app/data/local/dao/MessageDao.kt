/**

 * [getActiveConversations], [getMessagesOnce], [repointMessages] and [archiveConversation] are
 * what the legacy-conversation merge (`ConversationMigrator`) needs; [observeConversationById]
 * is the Room-backed half of the conversation observer. The old `markConversationAsRead` and the
 * unfiltered `getConversationsOrdered` were both removed as read state stopped living in a
 * stored counter and the account-wide conversation list went away with the sync loop.
 * Splitting messages and conversations into two DAOs would satisfy the threshold but is a
 * larger, unrelated refactor of every existing call site.
