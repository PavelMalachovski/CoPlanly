     * that accepted long ago — see `functions/index.js`) was never noticed by a running app:
     * this device would keep stamping new records with the slot it already had, while Firestore
     * held the new one, and every record it had ever created would start reading as its
     * co-parent's the moment anyone compared the two.
     *
     * [updatedUser]'s role is handed to [ParentSlotMigrator.reslotIfSlotChanged] as the incoming
     * value; the *previous* value it compares against is not read from Room at all — see that
     * method's KDoc for why `role` cannot be the "before" side of this comparison (it is never
     * written by the accept path, it is seeded with a placeholder on profile creation, and it is
     * written non-atomically with respect to the re-stamp).
     *
     * A failure reacting to the change is logged and swallowed rather than left to fail
     * [performFullSync]: the token, `partnerId` and `role` fields already written above are
     * real progress, and a re-stamp failure must not undo it by aborting the events and
     * child-info steps that run after this one for the same sync pass.
