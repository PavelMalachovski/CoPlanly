    /**
     * Mirrors an observed pairing transition into the local Room `users` row and, on a
     * transition into [PairingState.Paired], makes sure the 1:1 conversation exists.
     *
     * Everything outside the pairing screen reads pairing from Room, not from Firestore:
     * `ChatViewModel` decides between "open chat" and "go pair" from it, `ExpenseRepositoryImpl`
     * and `BudgetRepositoryImpl` derive the `familyId` they query on from it, `SyncService`
     * sizes the event audience with it, and `HomeViewModel` renders its CTA from it. Before
     * this hook the only writer was `UserRepositoryImpl.pullOnce()` behind a 15-minute
     * `SyncWorker`, so both phones showed "Paired with X" while chat, expenses, budgets and
     * events stayed unpaired for up to a quarter of an hour — and after an unpair, the
     * ex-partner's records stayed in view just as long.
     *
     * It hangs off the *observed* state rather than off [redeem]/[acceptIncoming] so it fires
     * on both devices: the inviter's phone never calls anything, it learns about the pairing
     * from its own snapshot listener. That is also why conversation creation moved here from
     * those two call sites — previously only the accepting device created a thread.
     *
     * Best-effort by design: the pairing itself is already durable in Firestore, so a local
     * write failure must never turn into a failed pairing. It is logged and swallowed, and
     * the next emission (or the `SyncWorker`) retries.
     *
     * **A co-parent this device did not know about a moment ago also asks for a sync.** The
     * mirror above tells the app *that* it is paired; it does not fetch anything the pairing
     * entitles the two phones to. On the inviter's phone the next `performFullSync` is what
     * widens the audience of every child, pet and event created while unpaired
     * (`SyncService.backfillChildInfoAudienceForPartner` and its siblings), and on the
     * accepter's phone it is what downloads them. Both used to wait for the fifteen-minute tick
     * — or for a push to happen along — which the onboarding wizard made visible the day it
     * started pairing *first*: a second parent who linked in order to inherit the first one's
     * records was standing on an empty child step, waiting for a worker that had no reason to
     * run. The request is keyed on the transition, not on every emission, and coalesces with
     * the cold-start run when the two land together.

     * so both parents get a thread — it used to hang off [redeem]/[acceptIncoming], which
     * only ever run on the accepting device.

     * Best-effort: the pairing itself already succeeded server-side by the time this

     * and swallowed instead. This is safe because nothing depends on it having run:
     * `ChatViewModel.startConversationWithPartner` creates the conversation on demand the
     * first time either parent opens chat, through the same idempotent call as here.
     *
     * There is no get-or-create lookup any more. The id is derived from the participant
     * pair, so both devices compute the same one and a duplicate thread is impossible to
     * create — the lookup existed only to prevent duplicates that can no longer happen.
     *
     * [PostPairingConversationSetup] also folds any legacy conversation for this pair into the
     * canonical one right after creating it, inside this same `try` — so a merge failure
     * degrades exactly like a create failure: logged and swallowed, never surfaced as a failed
     * pairing.
