/**
 * The passphrase that opens the encrypted Room database (SEC-2).
 *
 * Minted once with [SecureRandom], wrapped by [EncryptionManager] — AES-256-GCM under an Android
 * Keystore key, hardware-backed where the device offers it — and the wrapped form kept in ordinary
 * preferences. The ciphertext on disk is worthless without the Keystore key, and the Keystore key
 * cannot be exported off the device, which is the whole property being bought here.
 *
 * **Why not `EncryptedPreferences`,** which the app already has and which is also Keystore-backed:
 * because of what it does when it cannot open its store. It clears the file and mints a fresh
 * keyset, and failing that keeps entries in memory only — exactly right for the Google refresh
 * token it was written for, where losing the credential costs one re-authorisation. Applied to
 * this passphrase the same behaviour would quietly hand out a *different* key on the next launch,
 * and the database encrypted with the old one would be unopenable with nothing to say why.
 * [EncryptionManager] has no such store to lose: the key lives in the Keystore itself.
 *
 * **The passphrase is text, not bytes, and it is hexadecimal on purpose.** It is used in two
 * places that take it differently — SQLCipher's `SupportOpenHelperFactory` takes bytes, and the
 * `ATTACH DATABASE ... KEY` statement of the migration takes a SQL string literal — and hex is the
 * one encoding that survives both without quoting or escaping. Base64 would have been shorter and
 * would have put `/` and `+` inside a SQL literal for no gain.
