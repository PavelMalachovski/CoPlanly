/**
 * The shared half of a family's parenting plan (MON-5).
 *
 * **One document per family, four maps, every one keyed by uid.** That shape is not a storage
 * convenience — it is what lets `firestore.rules` say "a parent writes their own key and nothing
 * else" in a way the server enforces. A document per parent would have needed a query to read
 * both halves, and a query cannot be constrained by a rule that keys on the document id.
 *
 * The id is `FamilyKey.of(myUid, partnerUid)`, so it is the same string `custody_models`,
 * `family_settings` and `conversations` are already named with, and no lookup is needed to find it.
