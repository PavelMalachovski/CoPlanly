/**
 * Entity representing a pet in the local Room database.
 *
 * List-shaped fields are JSON string columns, the same shape [ChildInfoEntity] uses —
 * the app never queries by medication or photograph, so relations would buy nothing.
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier for the pet
 * @property name The pet's name
 * @property species Stored [com.coparently.app.domain.model.PetSpecies] constant name
 * @property breed Breed, or null when unknown
 * @property dateOfBirth The pet's date of birth
 * @property medicationsJson JSON array of medications
 * @property vaccinationsJson JSON array of vaccinations
 * @property specialNeeds Free-text traits both homes must know
 * @property feedingNotes What and when to feed, walking routine
 * @property vetName Name of the veterinary clinic or vet
 * @property vetPhone Phone number of the vet
 * @property photosJson JSON array of photograph download URLs; `[]` when none
 * @property createdAt Timestamp when the record was created
 * @property updatedAt Wall-clock time, for display, when the record was last updated
 * @property createdByFirebaseUid Firebase UID of the user who created this record
 * @property lastModifiedBy Firebase UID of the user who last modified this record
 * @property syncedToFirestore Whether the record has been synced to Firestore
