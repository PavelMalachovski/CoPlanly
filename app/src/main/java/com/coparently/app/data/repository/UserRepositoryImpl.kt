/**
 * Implementation of UserRepository.
 * Maps between domain models (User) and data layer entities (UserEntity).
 * Integrates Firebase Authentication and Firestore for multi-user support.
 *
 * At detekt's `TooManyFunctions` threshold: it must implement every [UserRepository] member —
 * itself over that same threshold, deliberately, per its own class doc — plus the private
 * mapping helpers ([toDomain], [toEntity], [toUser]) that keep Room, Firestore and the domain
 * model in sync. Splitting those helpers out would not reduce the real complexity, only hide it

     *
     * Three properties this has to get right:
     *
     * 1. **Merge, never overwrite.** The remote write goes through
     *    [FirestoreUserDataSource.updateUser], which is `set(..., SetOptions.merge())`, and
     *    carries only the keys that actually need to change. `partnerId`, `pairedAt`,
     *    `fcmToken` and `pendingRevocationOf` are therefore untouched. This replaces the
     *    dormant `upsertUser`, a full `.set()` that would have deleted every key it did not
     *    list — including `pendingRevocationOf`, the marker `unpairCoParent` leaves behind
     *    to remember whose shared access a partial revocation sweep still has to reach.
     * 2. **No downgrade.** Name, email and photo are resolved by [ProfileIdentity] in a
     *    strict preference order, so a session where Firebase Auth's top-level fields have
     *    no `displayName`, `email` or `photoUrl` (every email/password account, and a Google
     *    account whose record predates linking the provider — see
     *    [ProfileIdentity.ProviderIdentity]) keeps whatever real identity is already stored
     *    or, failing that, falls back to `providerData` before ever resorting to the email
     *    local part. A null photo is never written: "this session does not know one" must
     *    not be mistaken for "the user removed theirs".
     * 3. **Idempotent.** Nothing is written when the stored picture already matches, so the
     *    per-session and per-sync calls cost one cached document read.
     *
     * Best-effort by design: this runs in the background off the auth-state boundary, no
     * user action is waiting on it, and the next session (or the next `SyncWorker` pass)
     * retries. Failures are logged and swallowed.

     * Salvages whatever identity *is* known when no display name could be derived.
     *
     * A blank name genuinely cannot be written: the `users` **create** rule requires
     * `name` to be 1..100 characters, so a merge onto a document that does not exist yet
     * is rejected outright. The **update** rule says nothing about `name` at all, so a
     * document that already exists — the `fcmToken`-only one the FCM registration leaves
     * behind is the common case — can be merged into without one. Both halves of that are
     * pinned in `firestore-tests/rules/users-profile.test.js`.
     *
     * So the skip is narrowed from "write nothing" to "write everything except the name":
     * the email address and the avatar are real data the co-parent's pairing card renders,
     * and `id`/`firebaseUid` are what keep [pullOnce] from minting a random local
     * id later. Discarding them because one *other* field is unknown helped nobody.
     *
     * A null [remote] is deliberately treated as "do not write remotely". It means either
     * "no document" — where the create rule would reject this patch — or "the read failed",
     * where nothing is known about what is already stored. Neither is worth a denied write;
     * the next session retries.
     *
     * The log line is the point of the rest of this: it reports which inputs were absent
     * and what kind of session this is, so a device that keeps landing here can be
     * diagnosed instead of guessed at. See [ProfileIdentity.describeNameSources] for why
     * it carries presence flags and provider ids and no personal data — and, now that
     * [ProfileIdentity.resolveName] itself checks `providerData`, for why reaching this
     * method at all means that check already came back empty too.
     *
     * @param snapshot The same remote/local/provider data [ensureProfile] already read and
     *   built for [ProfileIdentity.resolveName]/[ProfileIdentity.resolveEmail] — passed in
     *   rather than re-read or rebuilt, so the log's `hasProviderName` reflects exactly what
     *   resolution just tried, and grouped into one parameter to stay under detekt's
     *   parameter-count limit (the same reason [ResolvedIdentity] exists).
     * @param email The output of [ProfileIdentity.resolveEmail], already provider-aware, so
     *   this method does not re-derive it with a narrower rule than the caller used.
