/**
 * Which family this device is currently showing, out of the ones the signed-in parent is in.
 *
 * A person may co-parent with more than one other adult, and the app shows **one at a time** —
 * a switcher rather than a merged view, because the alternative asks questions that have no
 * answer: two families have two independent custody schedules, and "whose day is it" cannot be
 * merged (docs/DESIGN-multi-family.md).
 *
 * **The selection is projected onto `UserEntity.partnerId`, and that is the design, not a
 * shortcut.** Something like a hundred and forty places read that field, and every one of them
 * wants "the co-parent of the family I am showing" — the audience an event is uploaded with,
 * the id a chat thread is derived from, the pair a custody schedule belongs to, the family an
 * expense query filters on. Re-pointing the single field they already read is what makes
 * switching a family a one-row write instead of a hundred and forty call-site changes, and it
 * is why the real list lives beside it in [UserEntity.partnerIdsJson] rather than replacing it.
 *
 * Two rules keep the projection honest:
 *
 * - **It is local only.** `UserRepositoryImpl.updateUser` deliberately stops sending
 *   `partnerId` to Firestore — the field is server-managed by the pairing callables, and
 *   publishing a per-device UI choice into a document the co-parent reads would be a different
 *   kind of bug entirely. The write here goes straight to [UserDao].
 * - **The selection is validated on every read**, never trusted. A stored id survives an
 *   unpair, and a family the account is no longer in must not select itself; an unknown id
 *   falls back to the first real one.
 *
 * Scoped per user for the reason `PreferenceKeys.PARENT_SLOT_MARKER_PREFIX` gives: Room rows
 * survive sign-out, so a second account on the same device must not inherit the first one's
 * choice.
