/**
 * Erases the signed-in account: everything the server holds, then everything this device does.
 *
 * **Why a callable rather than the client doing it.** `FirebaseAuthService.deleteCurrentUser()`
 * removes the Auth user and nothing else, and until this existed nothing called even that. The
 * documents an account leaves behind — its events, its child's medical profile, its half of the
 * chat — are spread across nine collections, several of which a departing user cannot read once
 * their `partnerId` clears, and none of which a client can delete in bulk. `deleteAccount` in
 * `functions/index.js` does the work on Admin credentials and deletes the Auth user last, so a
 * partial failure leaves an account that can still sign in and retry.
 *
 * **The local half is not optional.** Room deliberately survives sign-out so a returning parent
 * keeps their history, and [AccountSwitchGuard] only wipes when a *different* uid signs in — a
 * user who deletes their account and never signs in again would leave the whole database, chat
 * and medical profile included, sitting on the device. So the wipe is performed here,
 * explicitly, and only after the server reports success: clearing first would destroy the
 * user's data even on a run that failed and has to be retried.
