/**
 * Wipes the local database when a *different* account signs in on this device.
 *
 * Room deliberately survives sign-out so a returning parent's history is still there
 * (see `EncryptedPreferences.clear`). What must not survive is a *switch*: nothing in the
 * schema scopes rows to an account, so after A signs out and B signs in, B's Home, Calendar
 * and Expenses read A's rows — and worse, `SyncService.performFullSync` uploads A's
 * still-unsynced rows under B's uid and audience, turning a local privacy leak into a remote
 * write. Owner decision (Aug 2026 walkthrough): on a uid change the local data is cleared and
 * the new account sees only what the cloud holds for it; unsynced rows of the old account are
 * knowingly lost.
 *
 * The last-seen uid lives in its own **plain** `SharedPreferences` file, not in
 * [com.coparently.app.data.local.preferences.EncryptedPreferences]: it is not a secret — it
 * gates a wipe — and `EncryptedPreferences.clear()` runs on sign-out, which would erase the
 * very memory this check needs at the next sign-in.
 *
 * [ensureAccountConsistency] is called from two places, deliberately redundant:
 * [SessionProfileSynchronizer]'s auth-state collector (the session boundary every sign-in
 * passes through) and the top of `SyncService.performFullSync` (the choke point every upload
 * passes through). The second call is what closes the race — a periodic `SyncWorker` run can
 * fire before the collector has seen the new uid.
