/**
 * Keeps the signed-in user's profile document in existence and up to date, for the whole
 * session rather than for whoever happens to open a particular screen.
 *
 * Firebase Auth creates an account, not a `users/{uid}` document. Nothing else in the app
 * writes the user's own `name` and `email` there: the FCM registration writes `fcmToken`
 * with a merge (so the document exists, carrying that one key), the pairing Cloud Function
 * adds `partnerId`/`pairedAt`, and the app itself only read it. The
 * co-parent's pairing card reads `name`/`email` from that same document, so the gap
 * surfaced on the other phone as "Unknown"/"Email unavailable".
 *
 * The auth-state boundary is the correct trigger because it is the one event every signed-in
 * user passes through:
 *
 * - `AuthStateListener` fires immediately on registration, so a session restored from a
 *   build that never wrote a profile is repaired at the next cold start — no re-sign-in and
 *   no visit to the pairing screen required;
 * - it fires again on every sign-in and account switch, so a fresh account gets a profile
 *   before it can be paired with.
 *
 * The earlier version of this logic lived in the pairing ViewModel and therefore only ever
 * ran for a user who opened the pairing screen; the pairing rewrite dropped it, which is how
 * the underlying gap became visible.
