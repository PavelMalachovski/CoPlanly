/**
 * Entity representing a custody model configuration.
 * Supports various custody patterns including:
 * - Week on/week off (alternating weeks)
 * - Custom patterns (e.g., 2-2-3 split)
 * - The pattern repeats throughout the year
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier for the custody model
 * @property modelType Type of custody model: "week_on_week_off", "2_2_3", "3_4_4_3", "custom"
 * @property patternDays Number of days in the complete pattern cycle (e.g., 14 for week-on-week-off)
 * @property momDaysPattern JSON array of day indices (0-based) when mom has custody within the pattern
 * @property startDate ISO date string for when this pattern starts (anchor date for calculation)
 * @property isActive Whether this model is currently active
 * @property repeatYearly Whether this pattern repeats yearly (always true for MVP)
 * @property createdAt ISO date-time string when this model was created
 * @property lastModifiedAt Dead column — see the property's own note. Superseded by
 * [lastModifiedAtMillis].
 * @property lastModifiedAtMillis When this model was last modified, epoch millis
 * @property dayOverridesJson JSON object of one-off day swaps keyed by ISO date, mirroring the
 * shared document's `dayOverrides`; null on a row that predates the field and on any row that
 * has never carried a swap
