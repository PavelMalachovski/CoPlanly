    /**
     * Reads every event shared with [uid] — the user's own events plus the ones their
     * co-parent shared with them.
     *
     * The filter is `array-contains sharedWith` and not `whereIn("createdByFirebaseUid", …)`
     * on purpose. Firestore validates a *query* against its potential result set rather than
     * against the documents it actually returns, so a query is only accepted when its
     * constraints structurally guarantee the read rule. The `events` read rule is
     * `createdByFirebaseUid == request.auth.uid || request.auth.uid in resource.data.sharedWith`;
     * `array-contains sharedWith == uid` implies the second branch for every possible result,
     * whereas `whereIn("createdByFirebaseUid", [uid, partnerUid])` implies neither branch for the
     * partner half of the union and would be rejected outright.
     *
     * It is also the correct *result set*: a paired parent must see what their co-parent shared
     * with them, which ownership-keyed filtering cannot express. Writers stamp both parents into
     * `sharedWith` (see `EventRepositoryImpl.toFirestoreMap` and `SyncService.syncEvents`).
     *
     * This previously filtered on `parentOwner`, which holds "mom"/"dad" rather than a UID, so it
     * could never match — and, being unconstrained on any field the rule authorizes, it was
     * rejected wholesale, aborting the rest of the sync.
     *
     * **It no longer reads the whole collection every time (CQ-5).** `SyncWorker` runs every
     * fifteen minutes on both phones, and a couple at four events a day passes four thousand
     * documents in three years — a bill that grows with tenure rather than with use, landing
     * first on the users who stayed longest. With [changedAfter] set, the query returns only
     * what has been written since, which on a quiet quarter-hour is nothing at all.
     *
     * **Why the bound is a change cursor and not a date window.** A window on `startDateTime`
     * cuts off the master row of a recurring series that began before it — the series is still
     * live, but the row describing it is outside the window and stops arriving. A change cursor
     * has no such edge: a document is fetched because it *changed*, whenever its dates fall.
     * That also answers the other half of the question, which a `updatedAt` delta could not: a
     * tombstone deliberately does not move `updatedAt` (see `Tombstone`), but it does move
     * [serverUpdatedAt], because every write through this class is stamped.
     *
     * @param uid Firebase UID of the reader.
     * @param changedAfter Fetch only documents written after this, or null for the whole
     *   collection. Null is not just the first sync: the caller sweeps periodically, because a
     *   document written before [serverUpdatedAt] existed **has no such field**, and Firestore
     *   excludes a document that lacks the field from a `whereGreaterThan` entirely rather than
     *   treating it as zero. That is the same silent exclusion that dropped pre-fix `budgets`
     *   from their `whereIn`. The sweep is what makes this safe to ship with no backfill.
