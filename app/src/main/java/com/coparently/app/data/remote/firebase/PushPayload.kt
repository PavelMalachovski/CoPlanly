/**
 * What a queued push carries — the one definition both ends of it agree on (SEC-3).
 *
 * A notification used to arrive with its **text already written**: the sending device composed
 * `title` and `body` in English and `notification_queue` relayed them verbatim for the other
 * phone to render with the app's own icon and branding. That is a push that can claim to be
 * anything. The document is created by the client, so nothing between the two devices ever
 * decided what a notification was allowed to say — the bounds in `firestore.rules` capped its
 * *length*, which stops a wall of text on a lock screen and nothing else.
 *
 * Now a payload carries a [type] and the few facts that type needs, and the **receiving** device
 * writes the sentence. The frame — "New event", "Change requested", "Co-parent unlinked" — comes
 * from that device's own string resources and cannot be forged by anyone; only the names inside
 * it come from the payload, and those are names the co-parent is entitled to choose anyway,
 * because they are the event titles and child names they type into the app.
 *
 * ## Why this did not need the localization work it was blocked behind
 *
 * The backlog filed SEC-3 behind CQ-14 — service-layer strings are hardcoded English, so moving
 * composition server-side would need a locale stored per user and a string catalogue in
 * JavaScript. That reasoning assumed *server-side* was the only alternative to *sender-side*.
 * It is not: [buildFcmMessage in functions/index.js] already sends **data-only** messages with
 * no `notification` block, deliberately, so that the app always renders the push itself in every
 * app state. The receiving device is therefore already the one drawing the notification — and it
 * is the device that holds all five translations and knows which one the reader wants. Composing
 * there is both more secure and better localized than composing on a server, and it needs no new
 * profile field.
 *
 * ## The rule this pairs with
 *
 * `firestore.rules` refuses a client-written payload that carries `title` or `body` at all, and
 * accepts only the types listed in [CLIENT_TYPES]. The server-only types below are
 * produced by Cloud Functions, which write as admin and bypass rules — so a client cannot forge
 * a pairing notification or a chat message it did not send. Both halves are needed: without the
 * type allow-list a client could send `chat_message` with any sender name; without the
 * title/body refusal it could go back to writing the sentence itself.
