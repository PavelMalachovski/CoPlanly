/**
 * Merges a parent pair's legacy, randomly-id'd conversations into the canonical one.
 *
 * Before the deterministic id (`ConversationKey`), each device minted its own
 * `UUID.randomUUID()` conversation the first time it decided one was needed, so a pair's real
 * messages ended up split across two documents that never converged. This migration finds any
 * such leftover conversation for the current pair and folds its messages into the canonical
 * thread, then marks the leftover `archived` so it drops out of
 * [MessageDao.getActiveConversations] for good.
 *
 * **This is a complete no-op until the deployed `messages` rule allows the re-point.** The
 * `messages` update rule must permit a `conversationId`-only change into the canonical
 * conversation (see `canRepointMessage` in `firestore.rules`) before any of this can succeed
 * remotely. Against the rule that predates that change, every [tryRemoteRepoint] call below is
 * denied, [mergeOne] returns before touching anything local, and the legacy history sits
 * untouched under an id nothing observes — the same as if this class did not exist. That is the
 * correct, safe degradation (see the ordering note below), but it means the feature only starts
 * actually merging conversations on the first launch *after* the rule is deployed, not the
 * moment this code ships.
 *
 * **Ordering, and why it is idempotent and safe to interrupt at any point.** For each
 * candidate, every message known to belong to it — Room's copy unioned with a one-shot remote
 * read, see [collectMessageIds] — is re-pointed *remotely* first; only once all of them have
 * succeeded does the conversation get re-pointed *locally* (a single `UPDATE`, so a message can
 * never end up duplicated under two ids) and archived, on both copies. If the process dies or a
 * remote write fails partway through:
 * - before any remote re-point succeeded: nothing changed anywhere, so the next launch starts
 *   the same candidate over from scratch;
 * - after all remote re-points succeeded but before the local re-point/archive ran: the next
 *   launch re-attempts the remote re-point for the same messages, which is a no-op (Firestore
 *   already has the destination value), then proceeds to the local re-point and archive;
 * - after the local re-point ran but before the archive did: the next launch reads the same
 *   (still unarchived) conversation, finds Room has zero messages left under its old id (they
 *   already moved) while the remote read still finds the same ids, trivially "succeeds" the
 *   remote step again (each one is already at its destination), repeats the already-applied
 *   local re-point as a no-op, and archives it, completing the interrupted run.
 *
 * If some remote re-points succeed and others fail in the same pass, the conversation is left
 * unarchived and untouched locally, so the whole candidate is retried in full next launch — a
 * message is never re-pointed locally while its remote copy is still split, which is what would
 * make the local device believe the merge finished when the other parent still cannot see it.
 * The same caution applies to the message *list* itself: if the one-shot remote read that finds
 * messages Room does not know about fails, the candidate is skipped entirely for this pass
 * rather than proceeding on a local-only list that might be incomplete — a merge that cannot see
 * the full picture must not guess at it and archive on a guess.
 *
 * Once a candidate is fully merged, a second run does nothing at all: it is no longer
 * `archived = false`, so [MessageDao.getActiveConversations] does not return it as a candidate,
 * and the migration makes zero calls for it.
