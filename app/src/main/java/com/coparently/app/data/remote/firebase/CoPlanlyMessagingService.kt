/**
 * Firebase Cloud Messaging service for handling push notifications.
 * Extends FirebaseMessagingService to receive and process FCM messages.
 *
 * `functions/index.js`'s `sendNotification` sends a **data-only** message —
 * there is no top-level `notification` block. A message that has one is
 * auto-displayed by the OS from the system tray whenever the app is
 * backgrounded or killed, and [onMessageReceived] is never called for it in
 * that case, so this class's deep links, icon and per-type notification id
 * would only ever run while the app happened to be in the foreground. A
 * data-only message with `android.priority: "high"` is instead delivered to
 * [onMessageReceived] uniformly across foreground, background and killed
 * app states, so this class is always the one deciding how — and whether —
 * to show it. The one state neither message shape reaches is a
 * user-force-stopped app: the OS blocks FCM delivery there regardless, and a
 * `notification`-block message would have still surfaced from the tray in
 * that case where a data-only one will not.
