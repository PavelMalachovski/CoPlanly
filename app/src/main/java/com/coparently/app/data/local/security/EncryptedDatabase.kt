/**
 * Opens Room on an encrypted SQLite file, converting an existing plaintext one on the way (SEC-2).
 *
 * **What this buys.** `allowBackup="false"` and `data_extraction_rules.xml` already keep the
 * database off cloud backup and out of device-to-device transfer, so the residual exposure was
 * physical or root access to the device — where a child's medical profile, the whole chat history,
 * every expense and the `isPrivate` events that never leave the phone sat in a file any SQLite
 * viewer opens. SQLCipher encrypts the pages *and* the header with a key that only exists inside
 * the Android Keystore, so the file alone is worth nothing.
 *
 * It is not protection against a compromised running app, and it is not end-to-end encryption of
 * what syncs: what leaves the device for Firestore is governed by `firestore.rules`, unchanged.
 *
 * **Why the whole database rather than the medical fields.** The audit offered field-level
 * encryption of the medical profile as a smaller first step, and it is not a smaller step — it is
 * a broken one. `child_info` syncs, and this key is device-bound: a field encrypted here would
 * arrive at the co-parent's phone as ciphertext their Keystore cannot open. Making that work means
 * decrypting on the way out and re-encrypting on the way in, at every sync path, forever — more
 * code and more places to get it wrong than SQLCipher, in exchange for covering one table instead
 * of eleven. `SensitiveMedicalData`, the unused half-implementation of exactly that idea, is
 * deleted with this change rather than left as an invitation.
 *
 * **The migration is the risk, so it is arranged to be recoverable rather than fast.**
 * [SqlCipherMigration] decides what to do from the files on disk; this class only carries it out.
 * The one ordering that must never change: the plaintext database is deleted only after a
 * *verified* encrypted copy exists beside it under a different name.
 *
 * **Unverified on a device at the time of writing.** The project has no instrumented test job
 * (CQ-1) and the sessions that produced this have no Android SDK, so the pure decision layer is
 * unit-tested and the SQLCipher calls are not exercised at all. What *was* checked is that they
 * exist and mean what they say: every signature here was read off the AAR's own bytecode rather
 * than from memory, including the two that decide whether this is safe — `SQLiteConnection`
 * applies a key only when the passphrase array is non-empty (so the empty one below really does
 * open a plaintext file), and the default `DatabaseErrorHandler` **deletes** the database it is
 * handed, which is why [KeepOnCorruption] is passed to every open. The app is not published, so
 * no install but the developer's own is at stake — but the first run on a phone with real data is
 * an acceptance step somebody has to perform, and it belongs in REL-7's list.
