/**
 * What one import of a Google calendar actually took, and the two bounds it stopped at.
 *
 * Both bounds are carried rather than left implicit, because the defect this type exists to close
 * was not the truncation itself — a cap is reasonable — but that a truncated import was
 * indistinguishable from a complete one. A caller that cannot say "and there is more" will tell
 * the user the import finished.
 *
 * @property events The events fetched, in start order.
 * @property truncated True when the cap stopped the fetch and the calendar holds more inside the
 *   window. False means the window was read to the end.
 * @property from Start of the window actually queried.
 * @property until End of the window actually queried — supplied by the caller, or a default
 *   horizon, but never absent.

 * every interesting case (a limit landing mid-page, a last page with no token, a server that
 * keeps handing back tokens) is testable here without a Google client, a credential or a network.
 *
 * [maxPages] is not a product limit — it is the guard that stops a server returning a
 * non-advancing token from hanging an import. Hitting it reports [Paged.truncated], the same as
 * hitting [limit], because in both cases the caller holds less than the window contains.
