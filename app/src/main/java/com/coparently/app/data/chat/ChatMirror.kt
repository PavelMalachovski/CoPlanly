/**
 * Keeps the chat's Firestore listeners running for the life of the process, and restarts them
 * when they stop (CQ-8).
 *
 * **Why this class exists at all.** The two chat mirrors were being held open by a *screen*:
 * `NavGraph.rememberChatUnreadCount()` takes an Activity-scoped `ChatViewModel` and collects its
 * unread count forever, and that count used to subscribe to `observeMessages`. So the badge —
 * a piece of UI — was the only thing keeping the co-parent's messages arriving, which had two
 * consequences and both were bad. The count materialised the whole thread to answer a number that
 * `MessageDao.observeUnreadCount` answers with a `COUNT(*)`; and because the subscriber count
 * never fell to zero, `SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed` could never restart anything.
 *
 * That second half is the production defect. `MessageRepositoryImpl` ends both mirrors with a
 * `.catch` — it must, since an uncaught failure in a `viewModelScope.launch` terminates the
 * process — and `catch` *completes* the flow. After it fires, `merge(mirror, local)` runs on Room
 * alone: the app looks entirely healthy and receives nothing, until the process restarts. It was
 * seen exactly once and explains itself: on the first launch after install both listeners were
 * denied about half a second before `ensureConversation` had created the conversation document.
 *
 * **Two layers of recovery, deliberately different.** `MessageRepositoryImpl.reconnecting()` is a
 * fast, *bounded* retry — eight attempts, exponential, capped at a minute — for a blip. This is
 * the slow outer supervisor for an outage that outlives it. The roadmap's caution against an
 * unbounded retry is about the inner one, and it still holds: making *that* unbounded would
 * hammer a permanently broken rule and leave the give-up path spinning the virtual clock in any
 * test. The outer loop runs at [RESTART_DELAY_MILLIS], which on a genuinely broken rule is twelve
 * attach attempts an hour — the price of not silently losing a co-parent's messages for the rest
 * of the session, which in this product is the failure that matters most.
 *
 * **It awaits `ensureConversation` before subscribing**, which is the other structural fix the
 * roadmap named and the direct answer to what was observed.
 *
 * **It mirrors the family the device is showing** (M-8), through [ChatPartnerSource] — not the
 * server's first co-parent, which is what `PairingRepository.observePairingState` names and what
 * this class followed until then. A switch re-points the Room projection, the partner changes,
 * and `collectLatest` cancels the old thread's two listeners before the new thread's
 * `ensureConversation` runs: exactly one thread is mirrored at a time, never an accumulating set.
 * The families that are *not* on screen are therefore not mirrored at all, and their messages
 * reach Room only when their thread is selected again or opened — which is why no badge counts
 * across families (docs/ROADMAP.md M-8).
 *
 * The listener cost is not new. The Activity-scoped collector already held both listeners for the
 * whole process; this moves them somewhere that says so and can restart them.
