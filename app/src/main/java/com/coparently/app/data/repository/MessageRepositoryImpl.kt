/**
 * Room-backed implementation of [MessageRepository].
 *
 * Two independent realtime observers, neither nested inside the other: one for the
 * conversation document, one for its messages. The predecessor collected an infinite
 * conversation-snapshot flow and started a second infinite message flow *inside* that
 * collector, so the inner collect never returned and the outer one never advanced past its
 * first emission — which is why the two parents' threads never converged.
 *
 * Each observer mirrors what arrives into Room and hands the caller the Room-backed flow.
 * Room is the source of truth: a denied read, a missing index or a cold offline cache
 * degrades to "nothing new this round", logged, with the local copy intact.
 *
 * A failure now **reconnects** before it degrades — see [reconnecting]. It used not to, and the
 * difference was a session that looked entirely healthy while receiving nothing: `catch`
 * *completes* the mirror flow, so `merge(mirror, local)` ran on Room alone for the rest of the
 * process, and `SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed` could not restart it because `NavGraph` holds an
 * Activity-scoped `ChatViewModel` collecting the unread count for the whole process lifetime, so
 * the subscriber count never reaches zero. Seen in production on the first launch after install:
 * both listeners were denied about half a second before `ensureConversation` created the
 * conversation document, and that entire session ran on local data.

     * second before `ensureConversation` wrote the conversation document, and one retry would
     * have caught it. Blips, a rules deploy propagating and a short offline stretch are the same

     * degraded state, and still lasts until the process restarts, because nothing re-collects.

     * dropping the Activity-scoped collector that keeps `WhileSubscribed` from ever unsubscribing
     * — both larger than this, and both tracked as CQ-8 in docs/BACKLOG.md.
