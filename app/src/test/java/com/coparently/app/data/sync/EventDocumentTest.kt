/**
 * The events wire format, at the one field that crosses between two builds in both directions.
 *
 * `EventDocument` is the single reader of an `events` document and, since the member reference
 * landed, the single converter of the Room JSON column into the document's array. Both halves
 * are pinned here because the failure they prevent is silent: a tag that vanishes on the other
 * parent's phone looks exactly like a tag nobody set.
