/**
 * The database's version and its exported schemas must not drift apart (CQ-1).
 *
 * `app/schemas/` stopped at `14.json` while the database climbed to 33, and nothing noticed for
 * nineteen versions. The cost was not theoretical: `MigrationTestHelper` builds a database at a
 * past version *from these files*, so every migration since v14 shipped with no fixture to test
 * it against — and `DatabaseModule` deliberately refuses destructive migration above v4, which
 * makes a broken one a crash on launch for somebody with real data rather than a wipe.
 *
 * **What this test does and does not catch, corrected.** It reads `app/schemas/` off disk, and
 * KSP (Room) *writes* that directory during the build that precedes it — `room.schemaLocation` points
 * straight at the tracked path. So in CI the file it is looking for has just been created,
 * committed or not, and the assertion below passes on a repository missing the very export it
 * exists to demand. It was believed to be the gate for nineteen versions' worth of gap; it is
 * not, and the workflow step that *is* one (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, "The exported schema
 * must be committed") checks the thing git can actually see: that the build dirtied a tracked
 * directory.
 *
 * What remains genuinely useful here is the second test — a file whose name and contents
 * disagree is something no build regenerates away — and the first as a developer-facing check
 * when the schema directory is stale in a local working tree.
 *
 * It reads the source rather than the annotation. `androidx.room.Database` is retained at CLASS
 * level, so it is invisible to reflection, and loading `CoPlanlyDatabase` in a JVM test would
 * drag in the Android framework.
 *
 * **The versions between 15 and 32 are gone and are not coming back**: they were never committed,
 * and a build of today's code cannot produce them. That gap is accepted (see CQ-1 in
 * docs/ROADMAP.md); what this refuses is a *new* one.
