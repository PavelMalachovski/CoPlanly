/**
 * How a split agreed before there was anybody to agree with reaches the pair.
 *
 * The gap this pins was silent and complete: the unpaired branch of `submitRatio` can only write
 * `EncryptedPreferences`, its comment claimed "the first write after pairing publishes it", and
 * no such write existed anywhere. A parent who set 70/30 in the wizard paired, saw 70/30 in
 * Settings, and had both phones go on dividing every expense evenly — while the onboarding step
 * told them their co-parent would be asked to confirm it.
