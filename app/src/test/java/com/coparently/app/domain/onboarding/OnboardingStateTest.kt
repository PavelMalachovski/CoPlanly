/**
 * Whether a parent should be shown the first-run questionnaire.
 *
 * The case that matters most is the third one. Every existing installation upgrades into this
 * code with `onboardingCompletedAt` null, and handing a questionnaire to someone who has been
 * using the app for months — asking them for a child they already entered — would be the most
 * visible possible regression. An account that already has a name and a child is complete by
 * evidence, whatever the marker says.
