/**
 * Unit tests for [CustodyChangeAnnouncement].
 *
 * Custody is last-write-wins with no consent step, so the one thing this decision must get
 * right is that a losing write is never silently swallowed: it has to surface as "the other
 * parent changed it" unless it demonstrably is not that — and the reverse failure is just as
 * real: it must never report this device's own write as the co-parent's.
