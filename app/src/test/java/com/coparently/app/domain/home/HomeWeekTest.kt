 * The window, the filtering and the keys behind the home screen's week.

 * Kept pure and tested here rather than through the ViewModel because all three are arithmetic:
 * a seven-day window that starts on the wrong day, a private event that leaks, or two occurrences
 * of one series that collapse into one row are each a wrong answer with no exception to notice.
