/**
 * The wire shape of an announcement.
 *
 * The keys are pinned here on purpose. A co-parent on an older build has to keep reading the
 * `messages` collection, so renaming one later is not available — a test that fails on a rename is
 * cheaper than discovering it on somebody's phone.
 *
 * The dropping cases are the other half. An unrecognised `kind` from a newer build must not be
 * defaulted into a *different* kind: `Message.content` carries a plain-text fallback for exactly
 * this, so the reader sees something honest rather than a confident sentence about the wrong
 * thing.
