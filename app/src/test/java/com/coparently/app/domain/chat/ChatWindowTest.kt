/**
 * The chat's message window (CQ-6).
 *
 * `MessageDao.getMessages` was unbounded, so opening Chat materialised every message a pair had
 * ever exchanged. Bounding it is only safe if the reader can still reach the history — showing
 * the tail and saying nothing is the CQ-7 defect in a different collection — so what these tests
 * are really about is the button never disappearing while there is still something behind it.
