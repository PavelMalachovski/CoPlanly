/**
 * Replaces [FirebaseModule] for instrumented tests, so nothing reaches a real Firebase SDK.
 *
 * Without this the suite cannot run at all. Every provider in [FirebaseModule] calls a
 * `getInstance()` that requires a default `FirebaseApp`, and `FirebaseApp` is initialised by a
 * content provider that reads `google-services.json` — which is gitignored and has never existed
 * in CI. The first provider the graph touches therefore throws
 * `IllegalStateException: Default FirebaseApp is not initialized`, and because the graph is built
 * while `MainActivity` is being created, that kills the process and takes the whole
 * instrumentation run with it rather than failing one test.
 *
 * `HiltTestRunner` substituting `HiltTestApplication` does not prevent it: that stops
 * `CoPlanlyApplication.onCreate` from running, not the Hilt graph from being constructed.
 *
 * Shipping a fake `google-services.json` would also have worked and was rejected: the Google
 * Services and Crashlytics plugins in `app/build.gradle.kts` apply *only* when that file is
 * present, so adding one changes what every Android job builds — to fix a problem that belongs
 * to the tests. Replacing the module keeps the change inside `androidTest`.
 *
 * The mocks are relaxed because no test here asserts on Firebase: these tests are about
 * composables and about Room. What matters is that the graph builds and that
 * [com.coparently.app.data.local.CoPlanlyDatabase] is still the real one, so opening it through
 * SQLCipher (SEC-2) is genuinely exercised rather than stubbed out.
 *
 * **One exception, and only on the emulators.** When the run was started with an emulator host —
 * the `e2e` job, which runs nothing but `com.coparently.app.e2e` — Auth, Firestore, Storage and
 * Functions are the real SDKs of [EmulatorEnvironment.appUnderTest], pointed at the Firebase
 * emulators, so the app's own screens can be driven against a co-parent on the same backend
 * (`OneParentOnScreenTest`). Messaging, Analytics and Crashlytics stay mocks there too: FCM has no
 * emulator, and telemetry must never switch on in a test. Every other run sees exactly the mocks.
